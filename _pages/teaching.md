## CSCI 246: Discrete Structures

I am teaching this course in the spring of 2023. All course information can be
found [here](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci246-spring-2023/syllabus/).

Description from course catalog: *This course covers logic, discrete probability, recurrence relations, Boolean algebra, sets, relations, counting, functions, maps, Big-O notation, proof techniques including induction, and proof by contradiction.*

## CSCI 132: Basic Data Structures & Algorithms

I taught this course in the fall of 2022. All course information can be found
[here](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci132-fall-2022/syllabus/).

Description from course catalog: *An examination of advanced Java and basic
data structures and their application in problem solving. Data structures
include stacks, queues and lists. An introduction to algorithms employing the
data structures to solve various problems including searching and sorting, and
recursion. Understanding and using Java class libraries. The laboratory uses
Java. Introduces Big-O Notation.*

## CSCI 112: Programming With C

I am teaching this course in the spring of 2023. All course information can be
found [here](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-spring-2023/syllabus/).
I also co-taught  this course in fall 2022  with Dr. Mary Ann Cummings; course information through
D2L, and
I taught this course in the summer of 2021. All course information can be found
[here](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-summer-2021/syllabus/).
Description from course catalog: *C Programming knowledge. Introduces imperative programming
and the C standard library. Course covers pointers, memory management and
structures.* We also covered some C++ topics in this course.

## CSCI 127: The Joy & Beauty of Data

I taught this course in the summers of 2020 and 2019. 2020 course information can be found
[here](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/syllabus/) and 2019
course information [here](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/syllabus/).

Description from course catalog: *Provides a gentle introduction to the exciting world of big data and data science. Students expand their ability to solve problems with Python by learning to deploy lists, files, dictionaries and object-oriented programming. Data science libraries are introduced that enable data to be manipulated and displayed.*

## Teaching demonstration

On October 25, 2021, I gave a cybersecurity-related teaching demonstration to
beginning computer science students in Montana State University's CSCI 107 course.
My slides are [here](http://lgw2.github.io/files/security_teaching_demo.pdf).
