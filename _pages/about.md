### News

I will be joining the computer science faculty at the University of
Montana as an assistant professor in January 2024!

### About me

I am an assistant teaching & research professor in computer science at Montana
State University in Bozeman, Montana. You can reach me at lucia.williams (at)
montana.edu.

In fall 2023, I am teaching CSCI 112 and CSCI 246.
See my [teaching page](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/) for all of my
course materials.

I earned my PhD at Montana State as well,
 advised by [Brendan
Mumey](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bmumey/). My research focuses on the design
and analysis of algorithms for DNA sequencing and analysis.
In fall 2021, I visited the [graph algorithms team](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics/teams/graph-algorithms) within the [algorithmic bioinformatics group](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics) at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
See my [research page](https://lgw2.github.io/research/) for more detail on my
research pursuits.

Before my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising
company in Seattle, after earning undergraduate degrees in applied math and
urban planning.  Outside of work, my main hobby is playing and coaching
Ultimate Frisbee.  I also enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures.
