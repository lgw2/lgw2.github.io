I am a third-year PhD student in computer science at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana.
My advisor is [Brendan Mumey](https://brendanmumey.wordpress.com/).
I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms for all sorts of problems, especially those that can be
represented as graphs. Currently, I have two primary areas of research: decomposing
flow networks into paths with application to RNA assembly,
and using topological descriptors to compare 3D shapes without manual landmarking.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising company in Seattle, after earning
undergraduate degrees in applied math and urban planning.
Outside of work, my main hobby is playing and coaching Ultimate Frisbee. I also enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures.
