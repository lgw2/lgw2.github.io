I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at Montana State University in beautiful Bozeman, Montana.
I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms for all sorts of problems, especially those that can be
represented as graphs. (And there are a lot of those!) Currently, I have two primary areas of research: decomposing
flow networks into paths, and using topological descriptors to compare 3D shapes without manual landmarking.

Outside of academia, I play and coach Ultimate Frisbee. My team, [Seattle Riot](https://twitter.com/SeattleRiot),
won the world championship in 2018. I also coach the MSU college women's team, who made it to the game to go to
the Regional championship for the first time in 2018. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBYpCgQ0xmY) is a video
of me catching a pass in the semifinals of the 2016 US Open.
