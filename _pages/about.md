*In fall 2021, I am visiting the [graph algorithms team](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics/teams/graph-algorithms) within the [algorithmic bioinformatics group](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics) at the University of Helsinki in Finland.*

I am a fifth-year PhD student in computer science at Montana State University
in Bozeman, Montana, advised by [Brendan
Mumey](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bmumey/).  I design and
analyze algorithms and data structures for problems in computational
biology. Specifically, I study flow-network based methods for DNA sequencing and
methods for finding conserved genomic regions in the presence of missing data
or without a single reference genome.
Early in my PhD I also worked with the [Computational Topology and
Geometry](https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/index.html) group at MSU to develop
the theory behind a new method for comparing shapes without manual landmarking.
See my [research page](https://lgw2.github.io/research/) for more detail on my
research pursuits.

I've also had the pleasure of teaching three undergraduate computer science courses at Montana
State. See my [teaching page](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/) for all of my
course materials.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising
company in Seattle, after earning undergraduate degrees in applied math and
urban planning.  Outside of work, my main hobby is playing and coaching
Ultimate Frisbee.  I also enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures.
