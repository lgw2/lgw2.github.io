I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at Montana State University in beautiful Bozeman, Montana.
I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms for all sorts of problems, especially those that can be
represented as graphs. Currently, I have two primary areas of research: decomposing
flow networks into paths, and using topological descriptors to compare 3D shapes without manual landmarking.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising company in Seattle, after earning
undergraduate degrees in applied math and urban planning.

Outside of academia, I play and coach Ultimate Frisbee. My team, [Seattle Riot](https://twitter.com/SeattleRiot),
won the world championship in 2018, and I have competed at club or college nationals every year since 2010.
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBYpCgQ0xmY) is a video
of me catching a goal in the finals of the 2016 US Open with a previous team.
I also coach the MSU college women's team, who made it to the game to go to
the regional championship for the first time in 2018. 
I also do multi-day bicycle trips and host other touring
cyclists on a website called [warmshowers](https://www.warmshowers.org/users/lucygwi), and volunteer as a prep cook
at Bozeman's pay-what-you-can restaurant, [Fork and Spoon](https://forkandspoonkitchen.org/).
