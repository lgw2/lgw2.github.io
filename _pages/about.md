I am an assistant teaching & research professor in computer science at Montana
State University in Bozeman, Montana.
I earned my PhD at Montana State as well,
 advised by [Brendan
Mumey](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bmumey/). My research focuses on the design
and analysis of algorithms for DNA sequencing and analysis..
In fall 2021, I visited the [graph algorithms team](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics/teams/graph-algorithms) within the [algorithmic bioinformatics group](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics) at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
Early in my PhD I also worked with the [Computational Topology and
Geometry](https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/index.html) group at MSU to develop
the theory behind a new method for comparing shapes without manual landmarking.
See my [research page](https://lgw2.github.io/research/) for more detail on my
research pursuits.

I've also had the pleasure of teaching three undergraduate computer science courses at Montana
State. See my [teaching page](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/) for all of my
course materials.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising
company in Seattle, after earning undergraduate degrees in applied math and
urban planning.  Outside of work, my main hobby is playing and coaching
Ultimate Frisbee.  I also enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures.
