I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at Montana State University in beautiful Bozeman, Montana.
I am interested in the design and analysis of algorithms for all sorts of problems, especially problems that can be
represented as graphs. (And there are a lot of those!)

Outside of academia, I play and coach Ultimate Frisbee.
