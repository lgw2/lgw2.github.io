I am an assistant professor in computer science at the University of Montana
in Missoula, Montana. You can reach me at lucia.williams (at)
umontana.edu.

In spring 2024, I am teaching CSCI 432/532.
See my [teaching page](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/) for all of my
course materials.

From fall 2022-fall 2023, I was an assistant research/teaching professor at the
University of Montana.

I earned my PhD at Montana State University as well,
 advised by [Brendan
Mumey](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bmumey/). My research focuses on the design
and analysis of algorithms for DNA sequencing and analysis.
In fall 2021, I visited the [graph algorithms team](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics/teams/graph-algorithms) within the [algorithmic bioinformatics group](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/algorithmic-bioinformatics) at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
See my [research page](https://lgw2.github.io/research/) for more detail on my
research pursuits.

Before my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising
company in Seattle, after earning undergraduate degrees in applied math and
urban planning.  Outside of work, my main hobby is playing and coaching
Ultimate Frisbee.  I also enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures.
