I am a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at Montana State University
in Bozeman, Montana, advised by [Brendan
Mumey](https://www.cs.montana.edu/bmumey/).  I design and
analyze algorithms and data structures for problems in computational
biology. Specifically, I study flow network based methods for DNA sequencing and assembly and
methods for finding conserved genomic regions in the presence of missing data
or without a single reference genome.
I have also worked with the [Computational Topology and
Geometry](https://www.cs.montana.edu/tda/index.html) group at MSU to develop
the theory behind a new method for comparing shapes without manual landmarking.
See my [research page](https://lgw2.github.io/research/) for more detail on my
research pursuits.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at an online advertising
company in Seattle, after earning undergraduate degrees in applied math and
urban planning.  Outside of work, my main hobby is playing and coaching
Ultimate Frisbee.  I also enjoy human-powered outdoor adventures.
