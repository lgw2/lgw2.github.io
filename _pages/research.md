The focus of my work is the design and analysis of algorithms for practical
problems in computational biology.

## Network flow decomposition with application to multiassembly
My dissertation is on extending and designing algorithms for a flow network model
for assembling read data for tasks like RNA assembly and viral quasispecies
assembly.

## Maximal haplotype blocks with unknowns and pangenome SNPs
We are extending recent progress on the problem of finding maximal perfect
haplotype blocks from a set of SNP-resolved haplotypes to include unknown data
and to work in a pangenomic setting.

## Shape reconstruction using topological descriptors
We are developing algorithms to reconstruct shapes from topological descriptors such as persistence diagrams
and Euler characteristic curves.
