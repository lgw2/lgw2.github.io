## Maximal haplotype blocks with unknowns and pangenome SNPs
We are extending recent progress on the problem of finding maximal perfect
haplotype blocks from a set of SNP-resolved haplotypes to include unknown data
and to work in a pangenomic setting.

## Network flow decomposition with application to RNA assembly
We are extending a flow network model of RNA short read data to account for
errors in the data collection process
and developing algorithms to use this model to determine RNA transcripts and their abundances.

## Shape reconstruction using topological descriptors
We are developing algorithms to reconstruct shapes from topological descriptors such as persistence diagrams
and Euler characteristic curves.
