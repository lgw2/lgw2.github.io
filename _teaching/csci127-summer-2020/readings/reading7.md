## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, May 28th no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: complete the assigned number of activities in each
	of the assigned subsections of Chapter 16. You do not need to submit
	anything to Brightspace.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, Runestone Interactive will no
	longer allow you to collect points for completing the activities.

## Key ideas
### From chapter 16:
* A recursive algorithm must obey 3 laws:
1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.
* For some problems, a recursive solution may be more elegant
than an iterative solution.

## Assignment
* Complete the required number of activities for each subsection in
[Recursion](https://runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=37507).

## Grading - 10 points
* 10 points - the required number of activities were completed for each
	subsection before the deadline.

## Grading turnaround
This reading assignment  will be graded with scores in Brightspace by office
hours the following class day.
