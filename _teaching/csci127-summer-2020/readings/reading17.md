## Logistics
* Submission instructions: you do not need to submit this reading.

## Key ideas
* data_frame.column.value_counts()
* data_frame.column.sort_values()
* groupby
* Use [imbd_1000.csv](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/readings/imbd_1000.csv) to
follow along with the video.


## Reading
Read [Aggregation and Grouping](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/03.08-Aggregation-and-Grouping.ipynb) up to "Dispatch methods."

## Optional activities
1. Download [planets.csv](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/readings/planets.csv) and
[planets.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/readings/planets.py). Then,
* print the shape of the data set
* print the average orbital period in the data set.
* print out the number of entries in the data set per method.
* create a pandas data frame giving the median orbital period by measurement
	method in the data set.
