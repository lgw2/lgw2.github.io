## Quiz Info
Quiz 3 will take place on Thursday and Friday, 6/25 and 6/26, via D2L.
You can take the quiz
any time between 12am on Thursday, 6/25 and 11:59 pm Mountain Time on Friday, 6/26. You will have
one hour to complete the short answer and multiple choice portion of the quiz once you start it.
You can turn in the coding question as a .py file to the D2L dropbox until
11:59pm Mountain Time on 6/26.
The quiz will cover the Python topics and data science topics that we have learned so far:
data types, turtle graphics, modules, functions, selection statements, iterative statements, strings, recursion and lists,
files, dictionaries, object oriented programming, Numpy, Matploblib, and
Pandas, with a focus on material
that we have learned since the last quiz (Numpy, Matploblib, and Pandas). If
you have been able to complete the lab and programming assignments, you should
be able to complete the quiz.

The quiz will consist of two parts. Part 1 will consist of
five multiple choice or short answer questions
that are similar to the questions found in the textbook.
Part 2 will consist of one programming question. Unlike on previous quizes, you
may not have seen this question before.

You may use a computer to develop your answers.
You may only use the internet to access the interactive
Python textbook, the course website (including videos),
the Pythontutor code visualizer,
the online Python documentation or previous
Python programs that you wrote for this course (Labs 1-11 and Programs 1-5).
You are encourage to use the IDLE shell and run Python source code.

Once you have viewed the quiz, you may NOT discuss it with anyone until
Saturday, June 27th. Even telling a classmate that the quiz was difficult or
easy is not acceptable.
