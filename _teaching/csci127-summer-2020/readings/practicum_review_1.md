## Quiz Info
Quiz 1 will take place on Wednesday, 6/3 via D2L. You can take the quiz
any time between 12am and 11:59 pm Mountain Time on 6/3. You will have
one hour to complete the quiz once you start it.
It will cover the Python topics that we have learned so far:
data types, turtle graphics, modules, functions, selection statements, iterative statements, strings, recursion and lists.

The quiz will consist of two parts. Part 1 will consist of
five multiple choice or short answer questions
that are similar to the questions found in the textbook.
Part 2 will consist of one programming question, which will be taken
directly from the optional activities found in the reading assignment pages.

You may use a computer to develop your answers. You may only use the internet to access the interactive Python textbook,
the Pythontutor code visualizer,
the online Python documentation or previous Python programs that you wrote for this course (Labs 1-4 and Programs 1-2).
