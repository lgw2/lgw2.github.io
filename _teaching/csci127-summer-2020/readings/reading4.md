## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, May 21st no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: complete the assigned number of activities in each
	of the assigned subsections of Chapter 7. You do not need to submit
	anything to Brightspace.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, Runestone Interactive will no
	longer allow you to collect points for completing the activities.

## Key ideas
### From chapter 7:
* The `bool` type has values `True` and `False`
* Boolean operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
* Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
* Conditional statements: `if`, `if` `else`, `if` `elif` `else`
* Conditional statements can be nested
* Writing and calling Boolean functions


## Assignment
* Complete the required number of activities for each subsection in
[Selection](https://runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=37265).

## Grading - 10 points
* 10 points - the required number of activities were completed for each
	subsection before the deadline.

## Grading turnaround
This reading assignment  will be graded with scores in Brightspace by office
hours the following class day.
