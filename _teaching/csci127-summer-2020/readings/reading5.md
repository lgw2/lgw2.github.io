## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, May 22nd no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: complete the assigned number of activities in each
	of the assigned subsections of Chapter 8. You do not need to submit
	anything to Brightspace.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, Runestone Interactive will no
	longer allow you to collect points for completing the activities.

## Key ideas
### From chapter 8:
* for loop
* Know how to use `range`
* Know how to iterate over a string (e.g. `"Bozeman High"`) or a list
(e.g. `[1, "Potato", 2, "Potato"]`)
* while loop
* Know how to nest one loop inside of another


## Assignment
* Complete the required number of activities for each subsection in
[Iteration Revisited](https://runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=37266).

## Grading - 10 points
* 10 points - the required number of activities were completed for each
	subsection before the deadline.

## Grading turnaround
This reading assignment  will be graded with scores in Brightspace by office
hours the following class day.

## Optional activities
### Activity 1
Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 10.
The program should repeatedly ask the user to guess what the number is until
the user guesses correctly. When the user guesses correctly, the program should
print a message that shows how many tries it took.
For example, the message might be *Congratulations! That took 6 guesses.*

### Activity 2
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter two integers: one for the
number of rows and one for the number of columns. The program should then produce
a text-based drawing where each position in the drawing is randomly determined with
equal probability to be either a "\*" or a "-".
For example, with 4 rows and 6 columns, the drawing might look like this:
```
\*\*-\*-\*
--\*\*--
-\*--\*-
---\*-\*
```
