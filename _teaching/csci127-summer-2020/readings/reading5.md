## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, May 22nd no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: complete the assigned number of activities in each
	of the assigned subsections of Chapter 8. You do not need to submit
	anything to Brightspace.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, Runestone Interactive will no
	longer allow you to collect points for completing the activities.

## Key ideas
### From chapter 8:
* for loop
* Know how to use `range`
* Know how to iterate over a string (e.g. `"Bozeman High"`) or a list
(e.g. `[1, "Potato", 2, "Potato"]`)
* while loop
* Know how to nest one loop inside of another


## Assignment
* Complete the required number of activities for each subsection in
[Iteration Revisited](https://runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=37266).

## Grading - 10 points
* 10 points - the required number of activities were completed for each
	subsection before the deadline.

## Grading turnaround
This reading assignment  will be graded with scores in Brightspace by office
hours the following class day.
