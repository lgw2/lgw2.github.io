## Logistics
* Submission instructions: you do not need to submit this reading.

## Key ideas
About Numpy:
* NumPy is Python library written in C to provide fast numerical methods for scientific computation.
* NumPy enables Python users to use a data structure called an array. You can conceptualize an array as an efficient implementation of a list.

About Python notebooks:
* Python notebooks include code cells and text cells.
* They are useful for exploring data and for sharing your code with others.

## Assignment
* Read through the [Numpy Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a2ephx6o1xPjM3yUjvFEhCZsmcxL_UHe?usp=sharin://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a2ephx6o1xPjM3yUjvFEhCZsmcxL_UHe?usp=sharing) and do the Tasks.
