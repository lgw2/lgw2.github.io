## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, June 10th no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: complete the assigned number of activities in each
	of the assigned subsections of Chapter 17. You do not need to submit
	anything to Brightspace.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, Runestone Interactive will no
	longer allow you to collect points for completing the activities.

## Key ideas
* An instance of a class is mutable.
* A mutator method is a method of a class that changes the values of one or more instance variables.
* Shallow equality occurs when two variables refer to the
same object in the computer's memory. The Python keyword `is` tests for
shallow equality.
* Deep equality occurs when either there is shallow equality OR
two variables refer to objects that contain the same underlying
(significant) values.
* The method `__add__(self, other)` can be defined so that the operator
`+` can be used.


## Assignment
* Complete the required number of activities for each subsection in
[Object Oriented Programming](https://runestone.academy/runestone/assignments/doAssignment?assignment_id=37765).

## Grading - 10 points
* 10 points - the required number of activities were completed for each
	subsection before the deadline.

## Grading turnaround
This reading assignment  will be graded with scores in Brightspace by office
hours the following class day.
