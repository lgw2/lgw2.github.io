## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, June 23rd no later than 11:59pm.
* Submission instructions: upload solution,
entitled FirstName-LastNameLab11.py
to the BrightSpace Lab 11 Dropbox.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python
submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully
complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning outcomes
* Gain experience with pandas to manipulate data.
* Continue to gain experience with matplotlib.


## Assignment
* Download billionaires.csv from the website [here](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/billionaires/).
* Download [lab11.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/labs/lab11.py)
and rename it according to the instructions above.
* Implement the missing functions to match [this transcript](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/labs/lab11_output.txt)
and [this output file](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/labs/age_histogram.png).
* Hint: use plt.savefig(output_filename) to save the histogram to a file,
rather than displaying it when the program is run.
