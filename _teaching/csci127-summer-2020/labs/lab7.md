## Assignment
* A smart phone has the ability to save contact information.
In this assignment, you will simulate the contact list for a
very simple smart phone.
* Download [lab7.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/labs/lab7.py), rename it according to the instructions above,
and make sure you understand it.
* Take the program above and modify it by adding the missing
`Contact` class such that when the program is run, it produces
[this](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2020/labs/lab7_output.txt)
