## Logistics
* Due date: Thursday, June 27nd no later than 11:59 p.m.
* Submission instructions: upload your solution, entitled YourFirstName-YourLastName-Program4.py to the BrightSpace Program 4 Dropbox.
* Deadline Reminder: Once the submission deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your
Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit.
Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before
the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes
* To solve this problem, you need to understand the following Python concepts: object-oriented programming and lists.

## Background Information
The file [pokedex.txt](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/assignments/pokedex.txt) contains partial information about 31 Pokémon that mostly come from [this Pokédex](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all).

## Assignment
* Using [pokedex.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/assignments/pokedex.py) as a starting point, supply the
missing functions such that interaction with a user could produce this
[transcript](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/assignments/pokedex_transcript.txt).

## Grading - 100 points
20 points. The class `Pokemon` is defined (2 points) with the appropriate six methods (3 points each).

5 points. The function `print_menu` is correct.

10 points. The function `print_pokedex` is correct.

10 points. The function `lookup_by_name` is correct when the Pokémon is present (7 points) and absent (3 points).

10 points. The function `lookup_by_number` is correct when the number is present (7 points) and absent (3 points).

10 points. The function `total_by_type` is correct when the type is present (7 points) and absent (3 points).

10 points. The function `average_hit_points` is correct.

10 points. The format of the output matches the format of the output in the transcript exactly. (2 points for each type of difference up to 10 points.)

15 points - The Python solution is properly commented, easy to understand and does not contain unnecessary code. (3 points for each type of improvement up to 15 points.)
