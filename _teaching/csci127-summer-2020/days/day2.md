Chapter

## Key ideas

### From chapter 2:
* Simple python types: `int`(eger), `float`, `str`(ing)
* Determing type: `type`
* Declaring and using variables
* Assignment token: `=`
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
* User input: `input`

### From chapter 4:
* Turtle Module Methods
	* Creation: `turtle`
	* Movement: `forward`, `backward`, `goto`
	* x, y orientation: `right`, `left`
	* Pen control: `up`, `down`, `pensize`
	* Drawing Color: `color`, `fillcolor`, `begin_fill`, `end_fill`
	* Status: `heading`, `position`
	* Turtle type: `shape`, e.g. arrow, classic, turtle or circle
	* Turtle Imprints: stamp, dot
* Looping Construct: for
* onclick(), onrelease(), ondrag() from [turtle online documentation](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle)

### From chapter 6:
* Be able to write a function.
* Be able to call a function.
* Understand function parameters.
* Understand the difference between a fruitful function and a non-fruitful function.
* Understand the difference between a local variable and a global variable.
