# Create a one-dimensional array called v with 10 integers.
# Each integer should be a random number between 1 and 100.

# Create a new array which consists of the odd indices of
# previously created array v.

# Create a new array in backwards ordering from v.

# Create a two-dimensional array called m with 25 integers
# in a 5 by 5 matrix. Each integer should be a random number
# between 1 and 100.

# Create a new array from m, in which the elements of each row
# are in reverse order.

# Create another array from m, where the rows are in reverse order.

# Create another array from m, where columns and rows are in reverse order.

# Create another array from m, where the first and last row and
# the first and last column are cut off.
