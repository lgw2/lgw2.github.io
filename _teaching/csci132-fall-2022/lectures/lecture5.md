[lecture video]()


### The keyword `this`
* Within the body of a (nonstatic) method, `this` always refers to the instance
	upon which the method was invoked.

### Modifiers
#### Access control modifiers
* For classes, methods, and variables
* Controls visibility in the context of a larger program
#### The `static` modifier
* For variables and methods
* Value is associated with class as whole, not with an instance
#### The `abstract` modifier
* For methods
* We will learn about later
#### The `final` modifier
* For variables
* Makes it so the variable can never be changed after it is initialized
* If primitive, constant. If reference, a memory address.
