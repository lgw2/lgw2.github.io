title: "Lecture 7: Example: `CreditCard` class; UML class diagrams"
---

[lecture video]()

### Textbook section
1.7

### An example program: `CreditCard`

Demonstrates many of the things we've learned so far:
* modifiers (`private`, `public`, `static`)
* instance variables
* constructors
* methods
* the `this` keyword

The main method also demonstrates:
* an array
* a `while` loop
* a `for` loop
* a `for each` loop
* making calls to "normal" (nonstatic) methods
* making calls to static methods

### UML diagrams

A UML diagram gives the name, attributes, and methods of a class, along with
their visibility.

The first 3 minutes, 45 seconds of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic) give a nice overview. (The rest
of the video goes into inheritance, which we will cover next week.)
