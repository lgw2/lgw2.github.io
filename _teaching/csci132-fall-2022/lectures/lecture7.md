### Textbook section
1.7

### An example program: `CreditCard`

Build your programs one step at a time!

Demonstrates many of the things we've learned so far:
* modifiers (`private`, `public`, `static`)
* instance variables
* constructors
* methods
* the `this` keyword

The main method also demonstrates:
* an array
* a `while` loop
* a `for` loop
* a `for each` loop
* making calls to "normal" (nonstatic) methods
* making calls to static methods

### UML diagrams

A UML diagram gives the name, attributes, and methods of a class, along with
their visibility.

The first 3 minutes, 45 seconds of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic) give a nice overview. (The rest
of the video goes into inheritance, which we will cover next week.)

### Files used in class
* [CreditCard.java](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci132-fall-2022/lectures/CreditCard.java)
* [CreditCardDemo.java](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci132-fall-2022/lectures/CreditCardDemo.java)

### Additional exercises
* R-1.11 from book: Modify the `CreditCard` class to include a method that
	updates the credit limit.
* R-1.12 from book: Modify the `CreditCard` class so that it ignores any
	request to process a negative payment amount.
