### Textbook section
1.7

### An example program: `CreditCard`

Demonstrates many of the things we've learned so far:
* modifiers (`private`, `public`, `static`)
* instance variables
* constructors
* methods
* the `this` keyword

The main method also demonstrates:
* an array
* a `while` loop
* a `for` loop
* a `for each` loop
* making calls to "normal" (nonstatic) methods
* making calls to static methods
