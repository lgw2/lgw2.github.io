title: "Lecture 2: Java vs. Python"
---

Today, we'll learn more about Java by comparing it to what we already know
about Python.

[lecture video]

### What's going on behind the IDE?
* You can run Python in the interpreter...but not Java programs
* Java is compiled
* running Java programs from the command line

### What we need for a Java program
* Every Java program must define a class, and all code is inside a class
* Everything in Java must have a type
* Every Java program must have a function called 'public static void main(String[] args)'
