### Curcularly linked lists

Suppose I'm a pilot who always flies from Bozeman to Minneapolis to Seattle to
Bozeman to Minneapolis...

I want to keep track of my next three flights. If I'm in Bozeman, my next three
flights are Minneapolis->Seattle->Bozeman. If I'm in Seattle, they're
Seattle->Bozeman-Minneapolis.

We want a `rotate()` method!
