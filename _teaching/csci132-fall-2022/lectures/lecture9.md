Key ideas:
* What is a pointer?
* Declarations and manipulation of pointers
* `&` operator: address of
* `*` symbol meanings:
1. In a variable declaration statement, `*` means "pointer to"
2. In executable statements, `*` is the indirection operator and means "follow
   the pointer"
3. `*` is also a binary operator (needing two inputs) when we use it to mean
   multiplication.
* Pass by reference vs. pass by value review
* Equivalence of arrays and pointers
* Pointer arithmetic for arrays
* Why do we use pointers? To pass values by reference, to access arrays
	effectively, to allocate memory dynamically, and to define complex data
	structures.
