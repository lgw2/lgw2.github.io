### Textbook section
2.3

### Interfaces
In general:
* We don't need to know what's going on underneath the hood! We just need the
	interface to be specified.

In Java:
* An interface is a collection of method declarations with no data and no
	bodies.
* Interfaces have no constructors and they cannot be directly instantiated.
* A class then implements an interface.

### Abstract classes
* In between an interface and a normal (concrete) class

### Files used in class
