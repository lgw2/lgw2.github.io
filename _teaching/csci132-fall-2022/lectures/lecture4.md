title: "Lecture 4: Objects; reference vs. primitive data types; type casting"
---

[lecture video]()


### Objects
* Procedural programming vs. object oriented programming
* creating and using objects
* constructors
* fields
* methods
* running programs with `main`

### Reference vs. primitive data types
* reference data types store the location of the data (an object)
* primitive data types store the actual data

### Type casting
* explicit vs. implicit
* remember that Java is NOT dynamically typed (unlike Python)


### Files used in class
* [Counter.java](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci132-fall-2022/lectures/Counter.java)
* [CounterDemo.java](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci132-fall-2022/lectures/CounterDemo.java)

### Additional exercises

* Exercie R-1.10 from the book: Write a Java class, `Flower`, that has three
	instance variables of type `String`, `int`, and `float`, which respectively
	represent the name of the flower, its number of petals, and price. Your
	class must include a constructor method that initializes each variable to
	an appropriate value, and your class should include methods for setting the
	value of each type and getting the value of each type.
