### Abstract data type (ADT)
Abstraction of a data structure.

Specifies:
* data stored
* operations on the data
* error conditions associated with operations

### Stack
Has operations:
* `push(object)`: inserts an element at top
* `pop(object)`: removes and returns top element
* `top()` (or `peek()`): returns element at top of stack without removing
* `size()`: returns the number of elements stored
* `isEmpty()`: returns whether the stack is empty

Java has an implementation: [java.util.Stack](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Stack.html)
