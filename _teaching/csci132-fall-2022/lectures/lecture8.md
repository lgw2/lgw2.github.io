title: "Lecture 8: Object Oriented Design: Inheritance"
---

[lecture video]()

### Textbook section
2.1-2.2

### Object oriented design principles
1. Abstraction
* give an interface of an abstract data type (ADT)
* a class implements the interface
2. Encapsulation
* do not reveal the implementation details; just maintain the interface
3. Modularity
* organize different components of a system into separate functional units

### Inheritance
* hierarchical; uses "is-a" relationships
* we say that a subclass or child class extends a base class, parent class, or super class
* child class can augment by adding new fields and methods
* can also override an existing method
