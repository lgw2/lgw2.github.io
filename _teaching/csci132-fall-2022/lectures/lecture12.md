### Examples of developing C programs using pointers, strings, and structs

#### Problem 1 (recorded during class) [video](https://youtu.be/F0TKJGA3sbY)

Write in a program to read `classes.csv` (copy from `/public/pgm2/`).
Create an array of structs containing the course number
and the coures name. Include a function to print the struct so that you can
check your work.

#### Problem 2 (recorded during class) [video](https://youtu.be/q44JSsqsGU8)

Using your struct, allow the user to input a course number. Print out all
courses that have that course number or higher.
