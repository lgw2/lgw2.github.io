title: "Lecture 1: Intro to the course & getting started with Java"

Today, we'll go through the course syllabus and learn how to install Java on
our machines. We'll also see our first Java program.

### Getting set up to write Java programs

Download and install:
* Java JDK
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)

Note: you can use other IDEs such as [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or compile and run Java programs
using the command line; however, all class demonstrations will be done in
Eclipse, so the easiest way to keep up with the class will be to use that.
