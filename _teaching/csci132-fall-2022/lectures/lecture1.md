### Getting set up to write Java programs

* Download and install the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17). For Mac, choose the `.dmg` extension. For
	Windows, choose the `.exe` extension.
* Download and install the [Eclipse Integrated Development Environment](https://www.eclipse.org/) (IDE). When prompted by the installer, select "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"

Note: you can use other IDEs such as [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or compile and run Java programs
using the command line; however, all class demonstrations will be done in
Eclipse, so the easiest way to keep up with the class will be to use that.

### Running your first Java program

Follow these steps:
* open Eclipse
* create a new Java project (uncheck "Create module-info.java file")
* inside the `src` folder, create a new Package
* inside the Package, create a new Class
* use the green play button to run

### Files used in class

### Why Java?

* Learn a new language
* Used in industry
* Good for collaboration
* Fast
* Large standard library
