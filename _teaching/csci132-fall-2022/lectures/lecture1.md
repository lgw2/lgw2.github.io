Today, we'll go through the course syllabus and learn how to install Java on
our machines. We'll also see our first Java program.

### Getting set up to write Java programs

* Download and install the [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17). For Mac, choose the `.dmg` extension. For
	Windows, choose the `.exe` extension.
* Download and install the [Eclipse Integrated Development Environment](https://www.eclipse.org/) (IDE). When prompted by the installer, select "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"

Note: you can use other IDEs such as [Netbeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or compile and run Java programs
using the command line; however, all class demonstrations will be done in
Eclipse, so the easiest way to keep up with the class will be to use that.
