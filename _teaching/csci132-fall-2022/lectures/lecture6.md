title: "Lecture 6: Controlling the flow; `toString`"
---

[lecture video]()

### `toString`
For classes that we write, the default `toString` method returns the memory
location of the object. If we want something more useful, we can override the
method.

Use [this tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/understanding-toString()-method)
if you need another reference.

### Loops
* `for`
* `while`
* `do while`

### Branches
* `if`
* `else if`
* `else`
* `switch`

### Files used in class
See previous lecture for a `toString` example. We will also use the Project 1
starter code to look at examples of controlling the flow.

### Additional exercises
* R-1.5 from book: Write a short Java method that takes an integer `n` and
	returns the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.
* R-1.8 from book: Write a short Java method that counts the number of vowels
	in a given character string.
* Write a short Java method that takes a `char` grade and returns it as a
	`double` GPA score. You can use the following conversions: A (4.0), A- (3.7),
	B+ (3.3), B (3.0), B- (2.7), C+ (2.3), C (2.0), C- (1.7), D+ (1.3), D (1.0)
	and F (0.0). Write this method both using a series of `else if` statements
	and using a `switch` statement.
