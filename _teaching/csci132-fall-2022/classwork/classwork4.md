### Requirements

* Write your program in the `classwork` directory, inside another directory called
	`classwork4`, in  a file called `loops.c`.
* Compile your program into an executable called `loops` and run it using
	`./loops`.

## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - there is a file called `loops.c` in your
	`classwork/classwork4` directory.
* 9 points - it can be compiled and runs.

Note: you will not earn any points if your work is not committed and pushed to
Github with the tag `classwork4`.
