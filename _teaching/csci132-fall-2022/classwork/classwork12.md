title: "Classwork 12"

## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, June 2nd no later than 1:35pm.
* Submission instructions: push a commit with the tag `classwork12` to your git
	repository.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment. If the deadline is approaching, submit what you have in
	order to earn partial credit.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice solving a problem using recursion.

## Assignment

Write a program called `classwork12.c` that uses recursion to count the number
of letters in a word that the user inputs. You can assume that the word will be
no more than 20 characters long.

```
Enter a word (max length 20 characters)> Bozeman
Length is 7
```

Optional: ask the user for a maximum number of expected letters and allocate
space for your string dynamically. Before ending your program, use `free` to
free the space used by your string. In this case, interaction with the user
might look like:
```
Enter a max word length> 20
Enter a word no more than 20 characters> Bozeman
Length is 7
```

## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - there is a file called `classwork12.c` in your
	`classwork/classwork12/` directory.
* The file compiles and runs.
* Note: you will not earn any points if your work is not committed and pushed to
Github with the tag `classwork12`.

## Grading turnaround
This classwork will be graded with scores in Brightspace by 5pm the day it is
due (June 2nd).
