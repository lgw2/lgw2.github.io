## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, May 25th no later than 1:35pm.
* Submission instructions: push a commit with the tag `classwork9` to your git
	repository.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment. If the deadline is approaching, submit what you have in
	order to earn partial credit.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using strings and understand their relationship to chars.

## Assignment

Write a program called `classwork9.c` that reads in a single word from standard
input. You can assume that the word will be 25 characters or fewer and will
contain no spaces. Print the word and its first letter.

For example, a run of your program could look like

```
[p19t655@csci112 classwork9]$ ./classwork9 
Enter a word> fractal
fractal starts with the letter f
```

## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - there is a file called `classwork9.c` in your
	`classwork/classwork9/` directory.
* The file compiles and runs.
* Note: you will not earn any points if your work is not committed and pushed to
Github with the tag `classwork9`.

## Grading turnaround
This classwork will be graded with scores in Brightspace by 5pm the day it is
due (May 25th).
