## Assignment

Write one multiple choice question about any topic we have covered. There must
be at least two choices, but there can be more than that if you prefer.
Indicate what the correct answer is, and briefly explain why it is correct.
Finally, indicate which lecture topic or day your questioons is related to.

## Examples

```
What does the final modifier do?
(a) Makes a variable visible only to the class it is defined in
(b) Makes it so a variable can never be changed once it is initialized
(c) Makes it so a methood can be called using the class name, rather than an instance of the class
(d) Ends the program

The correct answer is (b), since that's precisely what the final modifier
does.

This question is related to the topic of modifiers from lecture 5.
```
