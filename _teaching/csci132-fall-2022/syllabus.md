Catalog description: 4 Credits (3 Lec, 1 Lab).
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 127 and M 151Q. An examination of advanced Java and basic
data structures and their application in problem solving. Data structures
include stacks, queues and lists. An introduction to algorithms employing the
data structures to solve various problems including searching and sorting, and
recursion. Understanding and using Java class libraries. The laboratory uses
Java. Introduces Big-O Notation

## Course resources
### Interactive Textbook
### Optional Textbook

### Office hours
Because there will be plenty of time for one-on-one help during the entirety of our
class period (11am-1:35pm), I am not scheduling regular additional office hours.
However, if you would like to meet with me outside of class time to ask a
question or work through a problem, you are welcome to send me a message anytime on Slack, and I will get
back to you as soon as I am available to answer your question or set up an
additional meeting time. This course moves quickly and I encourage you to get
help as soon as you need it!

### SmartyCats
In the past, there have been SmartyCats tutors available for this course. I
will update this if we are assigned one.

### Slack workspace
We'll be using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for *all* course communication
(except about grades or other sensitive information). It is very important that
you [join the Slack
workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/uw-ahq1567/shared_invite/zt-ptaqsozq-9bCEQWoPx7gu0iDE2GXeTw)
and check it every day of the course to keep up with announcements and to get
help when you need it. There are [plenty of videos
online](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+use+slack) that
can help you use Slack; most importantly, [you should customize your
notification settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfkX8oTalDg)!


### Visualizing your code
You can paste your C code into the tool [here](http://pythontutor.com/c.html) and see what executes with every step.
*Note: I have used this extensively while teaching Python, but this is my first
time using it to teach C. If you encounter anything fishy, let me know.*

### Checking your work
For most labs and programs, you will be required to match the example output.
To check that your program is working correctly, you should paste the example
output and your output into a tool like [diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/).

### Writing C code on the server
For this course, you will develop all of your programs on our MSU CSCI 112
Linux server. We cover how to use the server in the first lecture; see the
videos posted there.

## Course outcomes

By the end of the course, students should be able to:
* Navigate a Linux operating system using the command line.
* Use `vim` to edit files.
* Use `git` to version control their work.
* Write code using C syntax.
* Build computer programs using the C language.
* Take advantage of major capabilities of the C language, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation and structs.
* Apply the power of pointers, structs and strings to C programs.
* Apply the programming knowledge you learned to solve basic real-world problems.

*If we have time to cover C++, students will also be able to:*
* Write object oriented code in C++.
* Build object oriented computer programs using C++.
* Explain the difference between procedural programming and object oriented programming.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 14 classwork assignments: 14%
* ~~6 labs:~~ 5 labs: 36%
* ~~3 programs:~~ 2 programs 30%
* 3 quizzes: 20%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

## Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Share ideas with others.
* Help others debug their code (or receive help debugging your code from someone
	else).

You may not:
* Share your code with other people.
* Submit code that you did not write.
* Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own.


## Diversity statement
Montana State University's campuses are committed to
providing an environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member
of its community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon
race, color, religion, national origin, creed, service in the uniformed
services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran's status, sex, age,
political ideas, marital or family status, pregnancy, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
orientation. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working,
and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human
dignity and the positive connection among all people at our University. Acts of
discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic
violence, stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this
policy.

## Accommodations
If you have a documented disability for which
you are or may be requesting an accommodation(s), please contact
me and the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible.

## How to succeed in this class
What you can do:
* Keep up with the course by attending class,
checking Slack, being aware of the course
schedule, and doing all assignments on time.
* Be an active participant in class. This means asking and
answering questions in class and on Slack, seeking help
when needed,
and contacting me via Slack if you have any questions outside of class
time.
* Be respectful of both your classmates and me.
* Do your own work.

What I can do:
* Grade and return classwork the day it is due and lab and programs before the next course meeting.
* Respond to all Slack messages within one business day.
* Create a course atmosphere conducive to learning by respecting
all of my students and being
enthusiastic about course material and my role in helping you learn.
