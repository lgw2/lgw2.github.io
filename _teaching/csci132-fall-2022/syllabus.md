## Catalog description

4 Credits (3 Lec, 1 Lab).
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 127 and M 151Q. An examination of advanced Java and basic
data structures and their application in problem solving. Data structures
include stacks, queues and lists. An introduction to algorithms employing the
data structures to solve various problems including searching and sorting, and
recursion. Understanding and using Java class libraries. The laboratory uses
Java. Introduces Big-O Notation.

## Course Info

This course meets for lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
3:10pm-4pm in Reid Hall 103. Please bring a laptop to class so that you can
participate in the classwork exercises.  Lectures will be recorded and available on the day's lecture page (see schedule above) if you
would like to rewatch them. On Thursdays, there is a two-hour lab period in
which you can complete the week's lab assignment and get help from the course
assistants. We will use
Discord as the primary method of course communication, and all course
information will be posted on this website or on the Discord server; D2L will
be used *only* to turn in assignments and for grading.

## Course Resources
### Java documentation, tutorials, and useful links
* You can find the official Java documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/#JavaSE).
* An organization that I like, Runestone Interactive, makes an interactive
textbook for programmers who are coming from Python to and beginning to
learn Java. Check it out [here](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/java4python/index.html#).
* If you are interested, check out the [MIT Missing Semester of Your CS
	Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). It covers many of the tools you
	will use if you continue your computer science career, such as the command
	line, `git`, and much more.
* MSU has a [code of student conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/) that outlines the responsibilities of instructors and students.

### Optional textbook
The textbook is optional for this course. *Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*; 6th edition, Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser. It is available in the bookstore.
You can also [rent the eBook from Amazon for the semester](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/ref=d_pd_sbs_sccl_2_5/130-3299806-3656911?pd_rd_w=jeeqS&content-id=amzn1.sym.2dc9b33d-bf98-4c85-be26-75af626c0551&pf_rd_p=2dc9b33d-bf98-4c85-be26-75af626c0551&pf_rd_r=7ANTF6MGH1JPP6V86T2J&pd_rd_wg=BPMww&pd_rd_r=bddaaf8b-597e-4252-8635-740434fcff9d&pd_rd_i=1118771338&psc=1).

### Labs & course assistants

There are four lab sections, all of which meet on Thursdays in Roberts Hall 111. There will be a TA to help you. This TA will also grade your work, so please go to your assigned section. You should contact your TA via Discord if you have any questions about grading or need extra help.

* 001: 10am-11:50am, Asad Noor
* 002: 12pm-2pm, Nicholas Call
* 003: 2:10pm-4pm, Asad Noor
* 004: 4:10pm-6pm, Emmett Osborne

We also have 495 consultants to answer questions during lab. They are Jack
Tetrault and Josiah Schwahn (001), Mason Medina and Madison Munro (002),
Fletcher Phillips and Ara Megerdichian (003), and Steven Vought (004).

### Lecture videos

Lecture videos are hosted both on Panopto (MSU's screen capture and video
hosting service) and on YouTube. [Here](https://montana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=761aede1-cd37-4643-af61-af3b01276d2e) is the public link to Panopto. Lecture
videos on YouTube are linked on each lecture page. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFO-ZhHYOtp7pDRe9KtG7Tl_MRU2MFMH3) is the YouTube
playlist.

### Instructor office hours

My office hours are Monday and Wednesday 9:30-10:30am and Thursday 10-11am in
Barnard 359 or via Discord. You can also contact me on Discord to set up a
different meeting time. You can find office hours for all CS faculty [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

### SmartyCats

There is SmartyCats tutoring for this course! Visit [their
website](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/) to find out more.
You can also [apply to be a SmartyCats tutor yourself](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/apply.html) for other CS courses you've taken, or for this one next semester.

### Computer Science Success Center
There are free tutors available in Barnard 259. More information [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html).

### Discord server

All course communication will be through our course Discord server. Join with
[this link](https://discord.gg/KTMAb8Bwgg). It will prompt you to create
a new account, or you can choose to log in with an existing account.

### Course outcomes
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
* Design and implement a class in Java
* Explain the concept of an ADT
* Implement linked lists, stacks, queues, and deques
* Apply consistent documentation and program style standards in Java
* Be able to determine the time complexity of simple algorithms

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 13 labs (lowest score dropped out of 14): 30%
* 4 projects: 50%
* 3 quizzes (including final): 18%
* 2 course surveys: 2%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignemnts; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Discord, on D2L,  and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments are due on their due date by the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)
	timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe), which is 6 hours behind Bozeman. (This means that the real due
	date is 6am the following day.) If you submit a
	lab or project the following day before 8am, you get 25% off. If you
	submit within four days of the due date
	(by Monday AoE for labs; by Tuesday AoE for projects) you get 50%.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* Every student gets one free late pass with no
	questions asked for projects. This means you can submit up to
	four days late (by Tuesday AoE) with no penalty. Use this wisely! If you
	use this early in the semester and something unforseen happens, you will
	still need to submit the project on time or the penalties above apply. Please
	message the course assistant for your section on Discord to let them know
	you are using your late pass for a project. You should send this message
	before you make the submission, or shortly after.
* At the end of the semester, your lowest lab grade will be dropped.
* You can submit as many times as you would like; only your last submission will be
	graded.

### Missed quiz policy

Any conflicts with a quiz must be discussed with me prior to missing the quiz.
I follow University policy on makeups, which allows that serious illness or a
serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation. Most
other reasons (employment conflict, travel plans) are not valid.

### Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Share ideas with others.
* Help others debug their code (or receive help debugging your code from someone
	else).

You may not:
* Share your code with other people.
* Submit code that you did not write.
* Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

### Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is Sepember 7th. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is September 14th. The last day to drop with a W grade
(instructor or advisor approval required) is November 17th. See the full
[add/drop schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/add_drop_schedule.html)
for more information.
