Catalog description: 4 Credits (3 Lec, 1 Lab).
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 127 and M 151Q. An examination of advanced Java and basic
data structures and their application in problem solving. Data structures
include stacks, queues and lists. An introduction to algorithms employing the
data structures to solve various problems including searching and sorting, and
recursion. Understanding and using Java class libraries. The laboratory uses
Java. Introduces Big-O Notation.

## Course Info

This course meets for lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
3:10pm-4pm in Reid Hall 103. Please bring a laptop to class so that you can
participate in the classwork exercises.  Lectures will be recorded and available if you
would like to rewatch them. On Thursdays, there is a two-hour lab period in
which you can complete the week's lab assignment and get help from the course
assistants. We will use
Discord as the primary method of course communication, and all course
information will be posted on this website or on the Discord server; D2L will
be used *only* to turn in assignments.

### Course outcomes
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
* Design and implement a class in Java
* Explain the concept of an ADT
* Implement linked lists, stacks, queues, and deques
* Apply consistent documentation and program style standards in Java
* Be able to determine the time complexity of simple algorithms

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 11 labs: 33%
* 5 projects: 40%
* 3 quizzes: 18%
* interactive textbook assignments: 7%
* 2 course surveys: 2%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignemnts; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Discord, on D2L,  and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments must be turned in by 11pm on the due date. If you submit a
	lab or program between 11:01pm and 12 midnight, you get 25% off. If you
	submit after midnight on the due date but within four days of the due date
	(Monday at 11pm for labs; Thursday at 11pm for programs) you get 50%.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* One free late pass for labs: every student gets one free late pass with no
	questions asked for labs (not programs). This means you can submit up to
	four days late (by Monday at 11pm) with no penalty. Use this wisely! If you
	use this early in the semester and something unforseen happens, you will
	still need to submit the lab on time.
*

## Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Share ideas with others.
* Help others debug their code (or receive help debugging your code from someone
	else).

You may not:
* Share your code with other people.
* Submit code that you did not write.
* Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own.


## Diversity statement
Montana State University's campuses are committed to
providing an environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member
of its community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon
race, color, religion, national origin, creed, service in the uniformed
services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran's status, sex, age,
political ideas, marital or family status, pregnancy, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
orientation. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working,
and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human
dignity and the positive connection among all people at our University. Acts of
discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic
violence, stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this
policy.

## Accommodations
If you have a documented disability for which
you are or may be requesting an accommodation(s), please contact
me and the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible.

## How to succeed in this class
