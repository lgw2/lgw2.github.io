## Seminar goals

Our seminar has a number of goals. These may change as we go!
* To practice reading academic research papers.
* To practice presenting and discussing academic research.
* To learn about recent research in bioinformatics.
* To learn about foundational topics in bioinformatics.
* To start research conversations and find new research directions.

## How it works

Every semester, we will choose a set of papers to read as a group. Each paper
will have two leaders, who will lead two weeks of discussion of the paper.

### If you are a discussion leader

* Meet with your partner at least once to plan how you will lead
    discussion.
* A few days before your the meeting, send a message in Discord saying which
    parts of the paper you will be focusing on and sharing any other
    information you think will be helpful for the rest of the group to prepare
    to have a productive discussion.
