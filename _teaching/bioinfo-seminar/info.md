## Seminar goals

Our seminar has a number of goals. These may change as we go!
* To practice reading academic research papers.
* To practice presenting and discussing academic research.
* To learn about recent research in bioinformatics.
* To learn about foundational topics in bioinformatics.
* To start research conversations and find new research directions.

## How it works

Every semester, we will choose a set of papers to read as a group. Each paper
will have two leaders, who will lead two weeks of discussion of the paper.

### If you are a discussion leader

* Get started early! Research papers are dense and you will need to gain a
    solid understanding of at least the basics of the paper in order to lead
    discussion. I suggest skimming the paper two weeks in advance at least.
* Leading discussion can look different for different groups and different
    papers. However you choose to do it, be sure to explain the big picture of
    the paper (what problem is it solving? why was the problem previously
    unsolved? what allowed them to solve the problem? why do we care?) and give
    lots of opportunity for interaction and discussion.
* Meet with your partner at least once to plan how you will lead
    discussion.
* A few days before the meeting, send a message in Discord saying which
    parts of the paper you will be focusing on and sharing any other
    information you think will be helpful for the rest of the group to prepare
    to have a productive discussion.

## If you are not a discussion leader

* Spend 1-2 hours prepping for each meeting, focusing on the sections of the
    paper that the
    discussion leaders posted about in Discord. This often looks like skimming the
    paper, trying to understand the big picture at least, and only looking at
    details if you have time. You may also find other resources to help you
    understand the paper, such as author talks, explanation of topics you are
    unfamiliar with, or other related academic papers. If you find resources others might find
    helpful, feel free to post them in Discord!
* During the meeting, stay engaged with the discussion leaders and the group.
    Ask questions, share your thoughts or critiques of the paper, etc.
* After the meeting, share (1) something you thought the discussion leaders did
    well and (2) something you are still confused about or would like to learn
    more about regarding the paper.
