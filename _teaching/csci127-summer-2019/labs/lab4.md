## Logistics
* Due: Monday, June 17th no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: have one partner upload your solution,
entitled FirstName-LastName-Lab4.py
to the BrightSpace Lab 4 Dropbox.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python
submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully
complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning outcomes
* Gain experience manipulating lists.
* Continue gaining experience using functions, iteration, and boolean
expressions.

## Background
In a soccer match, a win is worth 3 points, a tie is worth 1 point, and a
loss is worth 0 points. Due to poor record-keeping,
the MSU KickCats knows only how many games they played and the points they
earned in each season, but not how many games they won, lost, or tied.
They have hired you to write a program that reports the possible
combinations of wins, ties, and losses for each season.

## Assignment
* Download [lab4.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/lab4.py)
and rename it according to the instructions above.
* Replace the `pass` construct in each function with the necessary
Python code to produce [this output](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/lab4.out).

## Assumptions
There will always be at least one legal combination of wins, ties, and
losses.

## Test data
`soccer_seasons = [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 6], [17, 17], [17, 24], [0, 0], [10, 2], [10, 3]]`

## Grading - 10 points
* 2 points - the output format is matched exactly.
* 8 points - your program will be graded using a different value for
`soccer_seasons`. For each element that produces the correct output,
you will earn 1 point.

## Grading turnaround
All labs graded with scores recorded in BrightSpace no later than lab time (2pm) the following day.
