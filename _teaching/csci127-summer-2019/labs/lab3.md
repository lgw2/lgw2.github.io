## Logistics
* Due: Thursday, June 13th no later than 5pm.
* Partner information: complete this assignment with your assigned partner.
* Submission instructions: have one partner upload your solution,
entitled Partner1FirstName-Partner1LastName-Partner2FirstName-Partner2LastName-Lab3.py
to the BrightSpace Lab 3 Dropbox.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python
submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully
complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning outcomes
* Gain experience manipulating strings.
* Gain experience solving a problem using iteration.
* Gain experience solving a problem using recursion.

## Assignment
* Download [lab3.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/lab3.py)
and rename it according to the instructions above.
* Rewrite the body of the `count_built_in` function to calculate and return the number
of `z`'s in the paramter `sentence` using the built-in `count` method (see the documentation
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=isdigit#str.count)).
For example, if the sentence is `"Jazz music played during the movie Zootopia"`, the
function should return `3`.
* Rewrite the body of the `count_iterative` function to count the number of `z`'s in
`sentence` using a loop. (Do not use the built-in count method.)
* Rewrite the body of the `count_recursive` function to count the number of `z`'s in
`sentence` using recursion. (Do not use the built-in count method.)


## Grading - 10 points
* 3 points - the `count_built_in` function is implemented correctly.
* 3 points - the `count_iterative` function is implemented correctly.
* 4 points - the base case (2 points) and 2 general cases (1 point each) of the
recursive function are implemented correctly.

## Grading turnaround
All labs graded with scores recorded in BrightSpace no later than lab time (2pm) the following day.
