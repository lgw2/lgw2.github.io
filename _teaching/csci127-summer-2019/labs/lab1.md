## Logistics
* Due: Monday, June 10th no later than 5pm.
* Partner information: complete this assignment individually.
* Submission instructions: upload your solution, entitled YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab1.py
to the BrightSpace Lab 1 Dropbox.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python
submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully
complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning outcomes
* Meet your lab teaching assistant and classmates.
* Be able to modify a simple Python program.
* Be able to use Montana State's Course Management System, Brightspace, to submit an assignment.
* Be able to modify your Brightspace profile to include a recognizable photo or sketch.

## Assignment
* Download [etch-a-sketch.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/etch-a-sketch.py)
and rename it according to the instructions above.
* Modify the code so that whenever the color is changed, both the pencil and the entire square (where you click to change colors) change to the same new color.

## Grading - 10 points
* 0 points - If you are having trouble installing Python, bring your labtop to lab so that we can help you.
