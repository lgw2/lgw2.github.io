## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, June 11th no later than 5pm.
* Partner information: complete this assignment with your assigned partner.
* Submission instructions: have one partner upload your solution,
entitled Partner1FirstName-Partner1LastName-Partner2FirstName-Partner2LastName-Lab2.py
to the BrightSpace Lab 2 Dropbox.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python
submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully
complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning outcomes
* Gain experience writing a Python function.
* Gain experience writing Python selection statements.

## Assignment
* Download [taxes.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/taxes.py)
and rename it according to the instructions above.
* Modify the program by adding the missing function.
The missing function will use Python selection statements to calculate the amount
of tax that a single (unmarried) taxpayer owes using the table below.
If the missing function is implemented correctly,
[this output](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/taxes-output.txt) will appear.

|Rate|For Unmarried Individuals, Taxable Income Over|
|:---|:---|
|10%|$0|
|12%|$9,700|
|22%|$39,475|
|24%|$84,200|
|32%|$160,725|
|35%|$204,100|
|37%|$510,300|

## Grading - 10 points
* 7 points - Your program calculates the income tax for each of the seven test cases correctly
 (1 point each).
* 3 points - A function with the correct name (1 point), correct parameters (1 point)
and correct return value (1 point) is used in the solution.

## Grading turnaround
All labs graded with scores recorded in BrightSpace no later than lab time (2pm) the following day.
