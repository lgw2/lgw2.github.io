## Logistics
* Due: Monday, June 24th no later than 5pm.
* Submission instructions: upload solution,
entitled FirstName-LastNameLab6.py
to the BrightSpace Lab 7 Dropbox.
* Deadline reminder: once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python
submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully
complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning outcomes
Gain experience with object oriented programming.

## Assignment
* A smart phone has the ability to save contact information.
In this assignment, you will simulate the contact list for a
very simple smart phone.
* Download [lab7.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/lab7.py), rename it according to the instructions above,
and make sure you understand it.
* Take the program above and modify it by adding the missing
`Contact` class such that when the program is run, it produces
[this](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/labs/lab7_output.txt)
output.

## Grading - 10 points
2 points - The `create_dictionary` function returns a dictionary that contains the correct binary code for each character of length one.

1 point - The `create_dictionary` function returns a dictionary that contains the correct binary code for " " and ",".

4 points - When your program is tested with different values for the variable `sentence`, characters that exist in
the dictionary are translated correctly. For each different character that is translated incorrectly, one point will be deducted.

1 point - When your program is tested with different values for the variable `sentence`, characters that do NOT exist in
the dictionary are translated correctly to UNKNOWN.

1 point - The format of any output files created match the format of the sample output files exactly.

1 point - In a comment at the top of the python file that you submit, explain why the comma character
and the space character are treated differently in ascii-codes.csv.

## Grading turnaround
All labs graded with scores recorded in BrightSpace no later than lab time (2pm) the following day.
