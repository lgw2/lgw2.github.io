## Key ideas

### From chapter 11
* Opening a file
* Reading from a file: `open(filename, "r")`
* Writing to a file: `open(filename, "w")`
* Closing a file: `filevariable.close()`
* File reading methods
	* `filevar.readline()` - in conjunction with a while loop to read an entire file
	* `filevar.readlines()`
* File writing methods
	* `filevar.write(some_string)`
* Absolute File Paths vs. Relative File Paths
