## Reading
Detailed Numpy documentation can be found [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html#user). Focus on sub-section [What is Numpy?](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/whatisnumpy.html) and the section
[Quickstart tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html).

## Key ideas

About Numpy:
* NumPy is Python library written in C to provide fast numerical methods for scientific computation.
* NumPy enables Python users to use a data structure called an array. You can conceptualize an array as an efficient implementation of a list.
Array functionality:
* Array slicing
