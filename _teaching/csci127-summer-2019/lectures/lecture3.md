## Reading
Chatpers [5](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonModules/toctree.html)
and [9](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Strings/toctree.html).

## Key ideas

### From chapter 5:
* Be able to use the math module to solve problems.
* Be able to use the turtle module to solve problems.
* Be able to use the random module to solve problems.
* Be able to figure out how to use other modules when needed.

### From chapter 9:
* str type
* String concatenation operator: +
* Substring operators: in, not in
* String indexing, e.g. if mascot = "hawks", mascot[2]
* String comparison: <, <=, = =, >, >=, !=
* String slicing, e.g. mascot[1:3]
* Common methods:
	* Determining length: len
	* Related to case: upper, lower, capitalize
	* Related to whitespace: strip, lstrip, rstrip
	* Related to formatting: center, ljust, rjust
	* Related to finding substrings: find, rfind, index, rindex
	* Related to counting occurrences: count
* Useful constants:
	* string.ascii_lowercase
	* string.ascii_uppercase
	* string.digits
	* string.punctuation
* Python documentation for strings: [Online Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=isdigit#string-methods)

## Active learning
### Activity 1
Review [key-events.py](
https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/key-events.py).
Then,
(1) Add appropriate comments to key-events.py.
(2) Modify the program so that pressing the f or F moves the turtle forward 50 pixels
in its current direction.
(3) Modify the program so that pressing the r, the R, or PageDown turns the turtle 45
degrees to the right but does not move the turtle.
