## Reading
Chapter [16](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/ClassesBasics/toctree.html).

## Key ideas

### From chapter 16
8 Thus far, we have used the *procedural paradigm* to solve problems.
With the procedural paradigm, the focus on solving a problem is on the actions.
In Python, these actions are implemented with functions.
* Python also supports the *object-oriented programming paradigm*.
With the OOP paradigm, the focus on solving a problem is on the objects.
An object contains both data (called the state) and functionality (called methods).
* Example: Consider the [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle) module.
This module is implemented using object-oriented programming.

## Active learning
### Activity 1
Create a class named Pokemon that has the following instance variables:
number, name and combat_points. Add a constructor method that enables
a new Pokémon to be created. Add methods named get_name,
get_number, get_combat_points and set_combat_points. Then, write a
program that utilizes the functionality of the Pokémon class in its entirety.

### Activity 2
