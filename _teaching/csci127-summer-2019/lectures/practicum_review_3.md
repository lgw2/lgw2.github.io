## Practicum Info
You can either take the Practicum on Wednesday, July 3rd from 2-4pm in BH 126, or on
Friday, July 5th from 2-4pm in BH 126.
It will cover the Python topics that we have learned so far:
data types, turtle graphics, modules, functions, selection statements, iterative statements, strings,
recursion, lists, files, dictionaries, and
object oriented programming, numpy, matplotlib, and pandas, with a focus on topics we learned since the
last Practicum. You can expect about a quarter of the questions to cover material from the first
practicum, about a quarter to cover material from the second practicum, and about half to cover material
since the second practicum.

You may bring one 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of double-sided notes.

You may use a computer to develop your answers. You may only use the internet to access the interactive python textbook,
the Pythontutor code visualizer,
the online python documentation or previous python programs that you wrote for this course (Labs 1-8 and Programs 1-4).
