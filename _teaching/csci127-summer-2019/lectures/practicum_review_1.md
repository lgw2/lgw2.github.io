## Practicum Info
The practicum will take place on Tuesday, 6/18 from 2-3pm in Barnard 126, our regular classroom.
It will cover the Python topics that we have learned so far:
data types, turtle graphics, modules, functions, selection statements, iterative statements, strings, recursion and lists.

You may bring one 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of double-sided notes.

You may use a computer to develop your answers. You may only use the internet to access the interactive python textbook,
the Pythontutor code visualizer,
the online python documentation or previous python programs that you wrote for this course (Labs 1-4 and Programs 1-2).
