## Key ideas

### About machine learning
* Supervised learning
* Feature variables and target variable
* Classification vs. regression
* Linear regression
* Decision trees

### Sklearn
* The first machine learning method we will look at is linear regression.
See the sklearn documentation:
[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html)
* We will also look at a specific measure of error, mean squared log error.
[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_log_error.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_log_error.html)
* We wil learn a second machine learning method: Decision Trees. [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html)
