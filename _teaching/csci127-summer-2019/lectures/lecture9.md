## Reading
Chapter [17](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/ClassesDiggingDeeper/toctree.html).

## Key ideas

### From chapter 17
* An instance of a class is mutable.
* A mutator method is a method of a class that changes the values of one or more instance variables.
* Shallow equality occurs when two variables refer to the
same object in the computer's memory. The Python keyword `is` tests for
shallow equality.
* Deep equality occurs when either there is shallow equality OR
two variables refer to objects that contain the same underlying
(significant) values.
* The method `__add__(self, other)` can be defined so that the operator
`+` can be used.
