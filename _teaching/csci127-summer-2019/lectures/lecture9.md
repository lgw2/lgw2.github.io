## Reading
Chapter [17](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/ClassesDiggingDeeper/toctree.html).

## Key ideas

### From chapter 17
* An instance of a class is mutable.
* A mutator method is a method of a class that changes the values of one or more instance variables.
* Shallow equality occurs when two variables refer to the
same object in the computer's memory. The Python keyword `is` tests for
shallow equality.
* Deep equality occurs when either there is shallow equality OR
two variables refer to objects that contain the same underlying
(significant) values.
* The method `__add__(self, other)` can be defined so that the operator
`+` can be used.

## Additional resources
In this course, we did not cover inheritance, which is a very useful feature of object
oriented programming. If you would like to read about it, check out [this short reading](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_inheritance.asp). You can also watch the
lectures from the Spring 2019 CSCI 127 course which address inheritance:
* [Ineritance 1](https://montana.techsmithrelay.com/Bv3L)
* [Inheritance 2](https://montana.techsmithrelay.com/Z3vN)
* [Inheritance 3](https://montana.techsmithrelay.com/90TP)

You can download the [dungeons.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/dungeons.py) file for an example of inheritance.

If you'd like to test your knowledge,

is an example question
using inheritance.
