Welcome to the first day of class!

## Reading
Chapters [2](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/toctree.html),
[4](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/toctree.html),
and [6](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/Functions/toctree.html).

## Key ideas

### From chapter 2:
* Simple python types: `int`(eger), `float`, `str`(ing)
* Determing type: `type`
* Declaring and using variables
* Assignment token: `=`
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
* User input: `input`

### From chapter 4:
* Turtle Module Methods
	* Creation: `turtle`
	* Movement: `forward`, `backward`, `goto`
	* x, y orientation: `right`, `left`
	* Pen control: `up`, `down`, `pensize`
	* Drawing Color: `color`, `fillcolor`, `begin_fill`, `end_fill`
	* Status: `heading`, `position`
	* Turtle type: `shape`, e.g. arrow, classic, turtle or circle
	* Turtle Imprints: stamp, dot
* Looping Construct: for
* onclick(), onrelease(), ondrag() from [turtle online documentation](
https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle)

### From chapter 6:
* Be able to write a function.
* Be able to call a function.
* Understand function parameters.
* Understand the difference between a fruitful function and a non-fruitful function.
* Understand the difference between a local variable and a global variable.

## Active learning
### Activity 1
Evaluate the following numerical expressions:
```
5 ** 2
9 * 5
15 / 12
12 / 15
15 // 12
12 // 15
5 % 2
9 % 5
15 % 12
12 % 15
6 % 6
0 % 7
```

### Activity 2
Download [madlib.py](
https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/madlib.py)
and modify it to create your own story.
Your modified Mad Lib should use
(1) at least one input that is treated as a string,
(2) at least one input that is treated as an integer and
(3) at least one input that is treated as a floating point number.
### Activity 3
Look at [racing-turtles.py](
https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/racing-turtles.py)
and make sure that you understand it fully. Then,
1. Modify the program so that a third racing turtle starts at coordinate (-200, -100).
2. Write down three other improvements to the program.
3. Find someone to discuss your proposed improvements with.
4. Implement at least one of your proposed improvements.

### Activity 4
Look at [etch-a-sketch.py](
https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/etch-a-sketch.py)
and make sure that you understand it fully.
1. Write down three improvements you could make to the program.
2. Find someone to discuss your proposed improvements with.
3. Implement at least one of your proposed improvements.

### Activity 5
1. TODO: choose an exercise from chapter 6.
2. Improve [house.py](
https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/house.py)
