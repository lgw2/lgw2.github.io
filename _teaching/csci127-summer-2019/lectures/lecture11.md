## Reading
Read [this tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) up to but not including the section called "Working with text."

## Key ideas
* `plt.plot()`
* line style and color: [https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.plot)
* working with multiple subplots
* histograms

## Active learning

### Activity 1
Download [graph.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/graph.py)
* Modify graphs.py to label the x-axis as x and the y-axis as y.
* Modify graphs.py to plot the straight lines with magenta dashes. Hint.
* Modify graphs.py to draw the sine wave with 5 point size.
* Add your own function `plot_new_func` that plots a different sort of function on the
same plot. Comment your function using a docstring.

### Activity 2
Download [diceSimulator.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/diceSimulator.py).
* change the simulator to roll 3 dice and display the results.
* change the simulator to roll 10,000 times.

### Acitivty 3
Download [montana.py](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/montana.py)
and
[montana.txt](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci127-summer-2019/lectures/activities/montana.txt).
* Modify the program above so that it shows the net population increase (or decrease) from one census date to the next in a second figure. (The first figure should continue to show the original graph.)
