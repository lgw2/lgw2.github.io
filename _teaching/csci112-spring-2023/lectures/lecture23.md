### Textbook chapters
4.1-4.2

## Experimental analysis

We can compare algorithms by implementing them and running them on a variety of
inputs. But this approach has drawbacks:
* different hardware and software may yield different runtimes
* some test inputs are missed
* we have to implement the algorithm

## Moving beyond experimental analysis

* Counting primitive operations
* Measuring operations as a function of input size
* Focusing on worst-case input

## Seven common functions used in algorithm analysis
* constant, $1$
* logarithm, $\log n$
* linear, $n$
* n-log-n, $n \log n$
* quadratic, $n^2$
* cubic, $n^3$
* exponential, $2^n$
