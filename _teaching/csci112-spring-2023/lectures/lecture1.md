* `.vimrc` file holds all of your `vim` configuration

Additional links and resources:
* Browser-based vim game to practice the vim keystrokes: [https://vim-adventures.com/](https://vim-adventures.com/) (if you
	get stuck, feel free to use Google to see how you're supposed to get
	through a section...)
