Quizzes will be on Brightspace and can be done on your own time.
The first quiz
will cover everything we have learned in the course through the lecture on Friday, February 17th, including
Linux, vim, and git basics.

Once you start the quiz, you have one hour to complete it. It will be open from
8am on Thursday, February 23rd until 6am on Saturday, February 25th.

For the  quiz, you may access a lot of resources:
* Any of the course videos
* Anything in the course Discord
* Anything linked from the course webpage
* The course textbook (Data Structures and Algorithms in Java)
* Any of your assignments or code you have written in class, or code in the
	`/public` directory on the server

Finally, you can write and run your own C code to check your answers.

You may *not* ask anyone else for help or Google anything.
