title: "Survey 2"

Surveys will be on Brightspace and can be done on your own time. The idea is to
give feedback on the course. You should be able to complete the survey in under
5 minutes if you like, or you can take longer and give more feedback.

For survey 2, you need to first do the university's course evaluation. Here are
