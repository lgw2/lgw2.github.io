## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 127. Programming knowledge. Introduces imperative programming and the C standard library. Course covers pointers, memory management and structures.


## Course Info

This course meets for lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
9-9:50am in Reid Hall 108. Lectures will be recorded and available on the day's lecture page (see schedule above) if you
would like to rewatch them. We will use
Discord as the primary method of course communication, and all course
information will be posted on this website or on the Discord server; D2L will
be used *only* for grading.

## Course Resources

### Textbook

The textbook is optional for this course, but is a good resource for anyone who
is interested. Most classwork and lab programming assignments will come from
the book, and lectures are based on the content in the book as well.

*Problem Solving and Program Design in C*, by Jeri R. Hanley & Elliot B. Koffman, Eighth Edition.

In Summer 2021 [rented it from
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Program-Design-C-ebook-dp-B00XIH482S/dp/B00XIH482S/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)
for $35 to use on the Kindle App on my iPad. Other options for renting or
buying the textbook exist. If anyone finds any particularly good ones, let me
know and I'll put them up here.

I also use *A Tour of C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup (the author of C++) as a
reference during the C++ portion of the course.

### Advice from previous students

At the end of the semester, I ask students what their advice for students who
will be taking this class in the future is. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_LzKcU1-jvHh8P8MJaxYzXBP0dJPxXOIVVaayRhDVKk/edit?usp=sharing) the compiled advice. There are some changes to the course this semester, but a lot of the advice is still relevant.

### Course assistants

There are four lab sections, all of which meet on Fridays in the CS Success Center (Barnard Hall 254). Your assigned TA (who will grade your work) will be present during their assigned hours, so you may want to go to that time; however, you can go during whatever time is best for you. You should contact your TA via Discord if you have any questions about grading or need extra help.

* 001:
* 002:
* 003:
* 004:

We also have 495 consultants to answer questions during lab.

### Lecture videos

Lecture videos are hosted both on Panopto (MSU's screen capture and video
hosting service) and on YouTube. [Here](https://montana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=761aede1-cd37-4643-af61-af3b01276d2e) is the public link to Panopto. Lecture
videos on YouTube are linked on each lecture page. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFO-ZhHYOtp7pDRe9KtG7Tl_MRU2MFMH3) is the YouTube
playlist.

### Instructor office hours

My office hours are TBD

or via Discord. You can also contact me on Discord to set up a
different meeting time. You can find office hours for all CS faculty [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

### SmartyCats

There is SmartyCats tutoring for this course! Visit [their
website](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/) to find out more.
You can also [apply to be a SmartyCats tutor yourself](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/apply.html) for other CS courses you've taken, or for this one next semester.

### Computer Science Success Center
There are free tutors available in Barnard 259. More information [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html).

### Discord server

All course communication will be through our course Discord server. See D2L
announcement for link. Please [change your nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to your full name (first
and last).

## Course outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
* Navigate a Linux operating system using the command line.
* Use `vim` to edit files.
* Use `git` to version control their work.
* Write code using C syntax.
* Build computer programs using the C language.
* Take advantage of major capabilities of the C language, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation and structs.
* Apply the power of pointers, structs and strings to C programs.
* Apply the programming knowledge you learned to solve basic real-world problems.
* Write object oriented code in C++.
* Build object oriented computer programs using C++.
* Explain the difference between procedural programming and object oriented programming.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 30 classwork assignments (lowest five dropped): 10%
* 4 projects: 50%
* 3 quizzes (including final): 18%
* 2 course surveys: 2%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignmnts; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Discord, on D2L,  and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments are due on their due date by the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)
	timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe), which is 6 hours behind Bozeman. (This means that the real due
	date is 6am the following day.) If you submit a
	lab or project the following day before 8am, you get 25% off. If you
	submit within four days of the due date
	(by Monday AoE for labs; by Tuesday AoE for projects) you get 50%.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* Every student gets one free late pass with no
	questions asked for projects. This means you can submit up to
	four days late (by Tuesday AoE) with no penalty. Use this wisely! If you
	use this early in the semester and something unforeseen happens, you will
	still need to submit the project on time or the penalties above apply. Please
	message the course assistant for your section on Discord to let them know
	you are using your late pass for a project. You should send this message
	before you make the submission, or shortly after.
* At the end of the semester, your lowest lab grade will be dropped.
* You can submit as many times as you would like; only your last submission will be
	graded.

### Missed quiz policy

Any conflicts with a quiz must be discussed with me prior to missing the quiz.
I follow University policy on makeups, which allows that serious illness or a
serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation. Most
other reasons (employment conflict, travel plans) are not valid.

### Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Share ideas with others.
* Help others debug their code (or receive help debugging your code from someone
	else).

You may not:
* Share your code with other people.
* Submit code that you did not write.
* Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own.
* Post your own solutions on the internet.
* Post the course assignments or quizzes on the internet.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

### Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is Sepember 7th. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is September 14th. The last day to drop with a W grade
(instructor or advisor approval required) is November 17th. See the full
[add/drop schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/add_drop_schedule.html)
for more information.


## Diversity statement
Montana State University's campuses are committed to

services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran's status, sex, age,
political ideas, marital or family status, pregnancy, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
orientation. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working,
and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human
dignity and the positive connection among all people at our University. Acts of
discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic
violence, stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this
policy.
