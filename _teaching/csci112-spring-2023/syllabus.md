## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 127. Programming knowledge. Introduces imperative programming and the C standard library. Course covers pointers, memory management and structures.


## Course Info

This course meets for lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
9-9:50am in Reid Hall 108. Lectures will be recorded and available on the day's lecture page (see schedule above) if you
would like to rewatch them. We will use
Discord as the primary method of course communication, and all course
information will be posted on this website or on the Discord server; D2L will
be used *only* for grading.

Note that this class is for Computer Science and Computer Engineering majors.
If you are not one of those majors, you should take CSCI 109 instead of this
course.

## Course Resources

### Textbook

The textbook is optional for this course, but is a good resource for anyone who
is interested. Most classwork and lab programming assignments will come from
the book, and lectures are based on the content in the book as well.

*Problem Solving and Program Design in C*, by Jeri R. Hanley & Elliot B. Koffman, Eighth Edition.

In Summer 2021 [rented it from
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Program-Design-C-ebook-dp-B00XIH482S/dp/B00XIH482S/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)
for $35 to use on the Kindle App on my iPad. Other options for renting or
buying the textbook exist. If anyone finds any particularly good ones, let me
know and I'll put them up here.

I also use *A Tour of C++* by Bjarne Stroustrup (the author of C++) as a
reference during the C++ portion of the course.

### Course Linux server

We have a shared course server for you to develop, compile, and run your C
programs on. Details for how to access the server can be found on the
[Classwork 1 page](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-spring-2023/classwork/classwork1/). Here is some additional information:
* If you have three unsuccessful login attempts, you will be blocked from the
	server for one hour. Try not to mistype your password! But if this does
	happen, DM me and if I'm available I will unblock you.
* The data on the server is backed up every morning. If you lose your code and
	want to access what you had when the backup happened, DM me on Discord and
	I will help you get it.

### Advice from previous students

At the end of the semester, I ask students what their advice for students who
will be taking this class in the future is. [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_LzKcU1-jvHh8P8MJaxYzXBP0dJPxXOIVVaayRhDVKk/edit?usp=sharing) the compiled advice. There are some changes to the course this semester, but a lot of the advice is still relevant.

### Optional open lab and TAs

There is an optional open lab on Fridays in the CS Success Center (Barnard Hall 254) from 10am to 4pm. Your assigned TA (who will grade your work) will be present during their assigned hours, so you may want to go to that time; however, you can go during whatever time is best for you. You should contact your TA via Discord if you have any questions about grading or need extra help.
*Note that there is no lab during the first week of classes (Friday, January
20th)!*

### Lecture videos

Lectures are recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements.

### Instructor office hours

My office hours are Thursdays and Fridays, 3-4:30 in the CS Success Center
(Barnard 259). You can also contact me on Discord to set up a
different meeting time, or drop by my office (Barnard 359) if my door is open.
You can find office hours for all CS faculty [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

### SmartyCats

There is SmartyCats tutoring for this course! Visit [their
website](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/) to find out more.
You can also [apply to be a SmartyCats tutor yourself](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/apply.html) for other CS courses you've taken, or for this one next semester.

### Computer Science Success Center
There are free tutors available in Barnard 259. More information [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html).

### Discord server

All course communication will be through our course Discord server. See D2L
announcement for link. Please [change your nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to your full name (first
and last).

## Course outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
* Navigate a Linux operating system using the command line.
* Use `vim` to edit files.
* Use `git` to version control their work.
* Write code using C syntax.
* Build computer programs using the C language.
* Take advantage of major capabilities of the C language, including pointers, dynamic memory allocation and structs.
* Apply the power of pointers, structs and strings to C programs.
* Apply the programming knowledge you learned to solve basic real-world problems.
* Write object oriented code in C++.
* Build object oriented computer programs using C++.
* Explain the difference between procedural programming and object oriented programming.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 23 classwork assignments (lowest four dropped): 10%
* 7 labs (lowest two dropped): 40%
* 2 projects: 30%
* 3 quizzes (including final): 18%
* 2 course surveys: 2%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), post in the `#errors-in-course-material` channel on Discord. I will decide whether
it's truly an error and not a duplicate. If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Additional work throughout the semester

Since four classworks and two labs are dropped, your work on dropped
assignments may
be counted as a bonus. There may be additional assignments that you can complete
for bonus as well. The exact computation will be decided later in the semester;
however, the maximum bonus you may earn from this is 3 points out of 100 for
the semester.

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignmnts; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Discord, on D2L,  and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments are due on their due date by the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)
	timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe), which is 6 hours behind Bozeman. (This means that the real due
	date is 6am the following day.) If you submit labs and programs  within 24 hours of the due date, you get 25% off of whatever score you earn. If you
	submit within two days of the due date you get 50% off.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* You can submit as many times as you would like; only your last submission will be
	graded.
* Classwork cannot be submitted late.

### Missed quiz policy

Any conflicts with a quiz must be discussed with me prior to missing the quiz.
I follow University policy on makeups, which allows that serious illness or a
serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation. Most
other reasons (employment conflict, travel plans) are not valid.

### Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Share ideas with others.
* Help others debug their code (or receive help debugging your code from someone
	else).

You may not:
* Share your code with other people.
* Submit code that you did not write.
* Modify someone else's solution and claim it as your own.
* Post your own solutions on the internet.
* Post the course assignments or quizzes on the internet.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

### Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is Sepember 7th. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is September 14th. The last day to drop with a W grade
(instructor or advisor approval required) is November 17th. See the full
[add/drop schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/add_drop_schedule.html)
for more information.
