## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, April 19th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`dynamic.c`) is in your
	`/classwork/week13/wed/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using `malloc` and `calloc` to dynamically allocate memory

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your home directory, navigate to `classwork/week13/wed/`, creating directories `week13`
and `wed` if necessary.
* Copy the `dynamic.c` file from `/public/classwork/week13/wed` and fill in the
	two TODOs. You should only need to add two lines of code to the file.

## Autograder

The autograder is not written yet, but your output should be
```
mypoint coordinates: 10, 5
intarr[2]=2
```
if you have done the assignment correctly.


## Grading turnaround

The autograder will be run at 6am to calculate final scores. Scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class period.
