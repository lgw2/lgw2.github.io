### Option 1
Work on Lab 1 or 2.

### Option 2

Open any graded classwork assignment and find the commands you can run to check
your work under "Hints". Can you find the use of redirection in the commands?
Can you explain in words what is happening?

Now do the following:
* Identify the part of the command that is redirecting `stdout`, remove it, and
	run the command. You should see the output written to the screen instead of
	to a file.
* Put the part of the command that is redirecting to `stdout` back in.
* Identify the part of the command that is redirecting `stdin`, remove it, and
	run the command. What happens now?
