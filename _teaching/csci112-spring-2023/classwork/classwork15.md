## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, March 22nd AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`dates.c`) is in your
	`/classwork/week9/wed/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice converting numbers to strings

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your home directory, navigate to `classwork/week9/wed/`, creating directories `week9`
and `wed` if necessary.
* Copy the file `/public/classwork/week9/wed/dates.c` to your current directory.
* In `dates.c`, write the function `nums_to_string_date` so that the program
	prints `3/22/2023`. You may need to look closely at the rest of the program
	to make sure that you write your function correctly.


## Autograder

You can run the autograder yourself by running
```
/public/classwork/week9/wed/autograder.sh
```
The `autograder.txt` file will be created or
replaced. You may get a few lines of output about not being able to remove
files, etc. This is okay.

## Grading turnaround

The autograder will be run at 6am to calculate final scores. Scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class period.
