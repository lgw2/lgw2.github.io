	this assignment.

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* Run `vimtutor` and proceed through lesson 4.
* After you have finished lesson 4, create the file
	`/classwork/week2/mon/vimtutor.txt` with the contents `Done through lesson
	4.`
* You can check that you will get full credit for this assignment by running
```
diff vimtutor.txt /public/classwork/week2/mon/expected_output.txt
```
You will see any differences between your file and the expected file on the
screen. If nothing happens, the content of your file exactly matches the
expected content. As long as your file is in the correct place and named
correctly, this means that you will get full credit for the assignment.

## Grading turnaround
