## Logistics
* Due: Monday, January 30th AoE.
* **If you want to see the results of the autograder so that you can check that you will get full credit**: create the directory `classwork/week3/mon`.
	You  don't need to put anything in it. But that's the only place that the
	autograder knows to put your file. You can still get full credit even
	without doing this, but you won't get the preliminary results.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required directory
	(`csci112_spring2023`) is in your home directory, that it is a git
	repository, and that it has a commit with the tag `lab1`.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Get your `git` repository set up and practice making a tagged commit.

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* In your home directory, create a directory called `csci112_spring2023`. Note
	that you must match this directory name exactly.
* Navigate into `csci112_spring2023`.
* Follow the instructions from the [git lecture notes](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-spring-2023/lectures/lecture2/) to initialize a git
	repository.
* Create a `labs` directory.
* Inside `labs`, create a `lab1` directory.
* Inside `csci112_spring2023/labs/lab1`, create any file. (An `example.txt`
	file with `hello, world!` in it, a start on your source code for lab 1,
	etc.)
* Follow the instructions from the [git lecture notes](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-spring-2023/lectures/lecture2/) to add all changes,
	commit, and tag the current snapshot of your repository as `lab1`..

## Grading turnaround
Preliminary results via autograder will be present in the appropriate classwork
directory in the `autograder.txt`, refreshed every 5 minutes during class and
every hour until 6am the following day. The 6am run is the final grade. Scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class period.
