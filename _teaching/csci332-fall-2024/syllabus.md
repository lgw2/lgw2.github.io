## Catalog description

3 Credits.
Prereq., CSCI 232 and M 225 or consent of instr. Algorithm design, analysis, and correctness. Commonly used algorithms including searching and sorting, string search, dynamic programming, branch and bound, graph algorithms, and parallel algorithms. Introduction to NP-complete problems.

## Course info

This course meets in Education 241 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
9:30-11:50am.

Class time will be a mix of lecture and active problem solving, both as
individuals and as groups. Every week will have a short homework assignment.
Most of your homework grade will come from a short homework quiz on Tuesdays,
where you will demonstrate your understanding of the algorithm analysis and
design topics from the homework.

## Course resources

### Textbook

The textbook for this course is Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva
Tardos.

### Lecture videos

Lectures will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=dcf4e4db-c07c-4d77-9063-b0f10157fd5d).

### Discord

TBD

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 10% homework completion
* 30% homework quizzes
* 10% exam 1
* 10% exam 2
* 20% final exam
* 20% participation

Your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in the `errors-in-course-material` Discord channel.
If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy


You may use *any* resource available to you, as
long as you write up your answers in your own words and properly cite your
source. Some examples of resources you might use:

* other students in the class
* other students not in the class
* other instructors
* textbooks or online notes
* anything you find on the internet
* ChatGPT or other AI tools

Please ask if you have questions about how to properly cite a source or a
collaborator.
