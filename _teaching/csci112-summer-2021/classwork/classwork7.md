title: "Classwork 7"

## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, May 19th no later than 1:35pm.
* Submission instructions: push a commit with the tag `classwork7` to your git
	repository.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment. If the deadline is approaching, submit what you have in
	order to earn partial credit.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using a makefile to compile and link separate C source files.

## Assignment

In your `classwork/classwork7` directory, copy your Lab 1 C source file, and
then separate it into at least three files, one containing your `main`
function, one countaining your compute discount function, and one containing
your print results function. (If you had more than three functions, you can
make one file for each or put more than one function in the files.)

Create a makefile so that all of the C source code files are compiled
separately. Make sure to use the `-Wall` flag to catch any warnings.


## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - there are at least three C source code file in your
	`classwork/classwork7`, one for each of the three functions discussed
	above.
* 9 points - your Lab 1 source code compiles and runs using `make`.
* Note: you will not earn any points if your work is not committed and pushed to
Github with the tag `classwork7`.

## Grading turnaround
This classwork will be graded with scores in Brightspace by 5pm the day it is
due (May 19th).
