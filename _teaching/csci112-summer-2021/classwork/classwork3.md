## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, May 12th no later than 1:35pm.
* Submission instructions: push a commit with the tag `classwork3` to your git
	repository.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment. If the deadline is approaching, submit what you have in
	order to earn partial credit.

## Learning outcomes
* Write your first C program.
* Familiarize yourself with C's I/O commands.
* Write a program that interacts with a human user.
* Write expressions using arithmetic operators.

## Assignment

*This comes from problem 7, chapter 2 on page 104.*
One barrel of oil provides 5.8 million BTU (British Thermal Units) of heat at maximum efficiency
A barrel contains 42 gallons of oil.
You are to determine how many BTU’s of heat are delivered to a house that is heated by an oil furnace.
This furnace is not perfect so it has some percentage of efficiency which will reduce the BTU’s to that percentage of the input.
Input from the user: amount of oil burned and efficiency of the furnace (both input as integers)
Output to screen: Amount of BTUs per million delivered to the house (printed as a doublewith 2 decimal places)

### Requirements

Write your program in the `classwork` directory, inside another directory called
	`classwork3`, in  a file called `heat.c`.
* Compile your program into an executable called `heat` and run it using
	`./heat`.
* Do not use globals.

### Hint
When dividing, use a real number, not an integer.

## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - there is a file called `heat.c` in your
	`classwork/classwork3` directory.
* 9 points - it can be compiled and runs.

Note: you will not earn any points if your work is not committed and pushed to
Github with the tag `classwork3`.

## Grading turnaround
This classwork will be graded with scores in Brightspace by 5pm the day it is
due (May 12th).
