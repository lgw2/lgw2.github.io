minimum, tell us your preferred name, your major (or intended major), and one
thing you are looking forward to during the course This can be course-related or
just something fun you've got going on during May or June.
* In a direct message to Lucy on Slack, send answers to the following
	questions:
	1. What time is classwork due?
	2. What time are labs and programs due?
	3. What is your github username?
	4. What part of the course makes up the most of your grade?
	5. Someone asks you for help with a lab because they are getting an error they don't understand.
	Is either of the following is okay?
	   (a) For them to send you a copy of their code for you to debug, or (b)
	   To get on a video call with them, have them share their screen, and show
	   their code to you while you talk them through debugging it?

### Part 2: Create a file, edit it with vim, and push to GitHub
* TODO: vimrc.
* Create a git repository named `csci112-2021-firstname-lastname` and clone it
	in your `/home/netid/` directory.
* Inside the `csci112-2021-firstname-lastname` directory, create
	following directories: `classwork`, `labs`, and `programs`.
* Inside the `classwork` directory, create another directory called
	`classwork1`. Inside that directory, create a file called `first_file.txt`.
	In that file, put whatever you want. For example:

```
This is my first classwork assignment!
```
* Add lgw2 as a collaborator (so that I can pull your work to grade it).
* Commit `first_file.txt` and add a tag of `classwork1`.
* Push your file to GitHub.
