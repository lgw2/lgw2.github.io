title: "Classwork 6"

## Logistics
* Due: Tuesday, May 18th no later than 1:35pm.
* Submission instructions: push a commit with the tag `classwork6` to your git
	repository.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment. If the deadline is approaching, submit what you have in
	order to earn partial credit.

## Learning outcomes
* Review anything you missed on Quiz 1.

## Assignment
Create a file called `classwork6.txt` in your `classwork/classwork6` directory.
Inside that file, 
for
every question you missed on Quiz 1, write a short explanation of the correct
answer.

For example, if you missed question 19 because you answered 0, you might write:

```
Question 19:
How many times will the block of code in this do while loop run?

int flag = 0;

do {

    // block of code
                                                                                                     
} while (flag == 1);

I answered this question as 0, since the condition flag == 1 is never true.
But in a do-while loop, the body of the loop always runs once before the condition is checked.
```

## Grading - 10 points
* 1 point - there is a `classwork6.txt` file in your `classwork/classwork6`
	directory.
* 9 points - it contains an explanation of the correct answer for each question
	you missed on quiz 1.
* Note: you will not earn any points if your work is not committed and pushed to
Github with the tag `classwork6`.

## Grading turnaround
This classwork will be graded with scores in Brightspace by 5pm the day it is
due (May 18th).
