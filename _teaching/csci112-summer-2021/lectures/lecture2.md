Today, we start to learn about the C programming language.

### Hardware and software
[video]()

[slides](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-summer-2021/lectures/ch1.pdf)

Optional reading: chapter 1

Key ideas:
* Hardware: memory cells, bits, bytes, memory addresses, RAM vs. ROM, CPU
* Software: operating systems, application software
* Computer languages: machine language, assembly language, high level
	languages
* Compiling your C programs: source file, compiler, object file, linker,
	executable file

### C overview
[video 1]()

[video 2]()

Optional reading: chapter 2.1-2.6

Key ideas:
* Parts of a C program: preprocessor directives (`#include` and `#define`), main function, declarations vs
	executable statements
* Variable declarations and data types
* Use `gcc -o [executable_filename] -Wall [c_filename]` to compile your program
	and `./[executable_filename]` to run
* Assignment statements
* Comments and whitespace
* `printf` and `scanf`: placeholders (`%`), float formating
* Newline and tab: `\n` and `\t`
* Arithmetic expressions

### Programming errors
[video]()

Optional reading: chapter 2.8

Key ideas:
* Four different types of errors: syntax errors, runtime errors, undetected
	errors, and logic errors

### Functions
[video]()

Optional reading: chapter 3.1

Key ideas:
* Use functions to organize your program and to reuse code
* Input (one or multiple) and output (only one) of functions
