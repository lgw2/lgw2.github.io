title: "Lecture 5: Input/Output File Redirection and Arrays"
---

### Input/output file redirection
[video]

Key ideas:
* `<` and `>` on Linux redirect standard input and standard output
* we can use redirection to read input from files and write output to files
	without changing our C code
* `scanf` returns the number of inputs successfully assigned, so can use a `while` loop with `scanf`
	to read lines of a file until end 

### Arrays
[video]

Optional reading: 7.1-7.5

Key ideas:
* Declaring arrays
* How arrays are stored in memory
* Accessing array elements using loops
* Using arrays in functions
* `const`
* conditional operator
