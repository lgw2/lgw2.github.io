### Intro to pointers
[video]

Optional reading:

Key ideas:
* What is a pointer?
* Declarations and manipulation of pointers
* Pass by reference vs. pass by value review
* `*` and `&`
* Equivalence of arrays and pointers
* Pointer arithmetic for arrays
* Why do we use pointers? To pass values by reference, to access arrays
	effectively, to allocate memory dynamically, and to define complex data
	structures.
* `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` (may be moving these to a later lecture)
