[video](https://youtu.be/GhRG26kSyBA)

We use selection sort in this video. Feel free to try another sorting algorithm
in program 1 if you like!

Optional reading: 7.6

[video]

Key ideas:

* as programs get larger, it is easier to organize them into multiple files
* In vim, you can use `tabe` to open up multiple files at once
