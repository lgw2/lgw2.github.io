title: "Lecture 1: Getting started with Linux, vim, and git"
---

Today, we are covering the course syllabus and the basic tools we need to
complete the work for the course: Linux, vim, and git. These aren't hard, but
they are not intuitive and it will take practice before you get comfortable.
Take the time now to go through the tutorials that I point to and you'll set
yourself up for success throughout the course.
