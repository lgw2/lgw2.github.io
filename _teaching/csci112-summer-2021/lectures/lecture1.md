title: "Lecture 1: Getting started with Linux, vim, and git"
---

Today, we are covering the course syllabus and the basic tools we need to
complete the work for the course: Linux, vim, and git. These aren't hard, but
they are not intuitive and it will take practice before you get comfortable.
Take the time now to go through the tutorials that I point to and you'll set
yourself up for success throughout the course.

Key topics:
* Using `ssh` to get to the server:
```
ssh [netid]@csci112.cs.montana.edu
```
* Linux commands: `pwd`, `ls` (`ls -a`), `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `touch`, `man`,
	`cp`, `mv`, Ctrl `c`, ctrl `d`, tab completion

Additional links and resources:
* For Windows users, download [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) (see
	"Installing Cygwin" section), open it, and use as you would the Mac/Linux
	terminal in the video.

Key ideas:
* Run `vimtutor` and get through Lesson 4 to practice vim commands
* `.vimrc` file holds all of your `vim` configuration

Additional links and resources:
* Browser-based vim game to practice the vim keystrokes: [https://vim-adventures.com/](https://vim-adventures.com/) (if you
	get stuck, feel free to use Google to see how you're supposed to get
	through a section...)
* A vimrc tutorial: [https://linuxhint.com/vimrc_tutorial/](https://linuxhint.com/vimrc_tutorial/)
