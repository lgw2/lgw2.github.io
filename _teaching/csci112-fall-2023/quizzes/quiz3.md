title: "Quiz 3"
---

Quizzes will be on Brightspace and can be done on your own time.
The third and final quiz
will focus on the material we covered since the last quiz (dynamic memory
allocation, dynamic data structures, and bit masking), but about one third of
the questions will be on material from earlier in the course.

Once you start the quiz, you have one hour to complete it. It will be open from
8am on Monday, May 8th until 6am on Wednesday, May 10th.

For the  quiz, you may access a lot of resources:
* Any of the course videos
* Anything in the course Discord
* Anything linked from the course webpage
* The course textbook (Problem Solving and Program Design in C)
* Any of your assignments or code you have written in class, or code in the
	`/public` directory on the server

Finally, you can write and run your own C code to check your answers.

You may *not* ask anyone else for help or Google anything.
