## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, September 27th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`hi.c`) is in your
	`/classwork/week6/wed/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice reading data from the command line
* Practice using arrays

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your `csci11_fall2023` directory, navigate to `classwork/week6/wed/`, creating directories `week6`
and `wed` if necessary.
* Write a C program in the file `hi.c` that takes one argument from the command line and prints
	`Hello, <arg>`! For example, if you run it with the input `Champ`, it
	should look like this:
```
[p19t655@csci112 wed]$ gcc -o hi -Wall hi.c
[p19t655@csci112 wed]$ ./hi Champ
Hello, Champ!
```

An autograder will be available for this assignment before 9/25.

## Grading turnaround
Final scores will be run at 6am on the due date and scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class meeting.
