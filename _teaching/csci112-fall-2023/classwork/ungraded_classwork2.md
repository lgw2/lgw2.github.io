### Option 1
Work on Lab 1. Remember to put your files in `csci112_spring2023/labs/lab1`.

### Option 2

Work on either of these problems. For both, complete the C program. (I'd paste
them into a `.c` file on the server so you can run your solution to see if it
works.) You may
want to add some user interaction to try out different values of the variables,
or you can just change the values of the variables directly in the code.



#### Problem 1

```c
int main(void) {
	int x;
	int y

	// re-assign values to x and y so that x holds the smaller value and y
	// holds the greater value

	return(0);
}
```

#### Problem 2

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	char road_status; // 'S' indicates slushy
	double temp; // temp in F

	// print out a message based on the road status and temperature.
	// if it's slushy and below freezing, warn that it's icy.
	// if it's slusy and above freezing, warn that it's wet.
	// if it's wet, warn that stopping distance is doubled.
	// if it's icy, warn that stopping distance is quadrupled.
	return(0);
}
```
