## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, November 8th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`dynamic.c`) is in your
	`csci112_fall2023/classwork/week12/wed/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using `malloc` and `calloc` to allocate memory on the stack..

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your home directory, navigate to `csci112_fall2023/classwork/week12/wed/`, creating directories `week12`
and `wed` if necessary.
* Copy the file `/public/classwork/week12/wed/dynamic.c` into your directory.

Fill in the two `TODO` items. You should only need to add two lines of code.

## Autograder
