## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, October 11th AoE.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required file (`tokenize.c`) is in your
	`/classwork/week8/wed/` directory.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Learning outcomes
* Practice using `strtok` to tokenize a string

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* From your `csci11_fall2023` directory, navigate to `classwork/week8/wed/`, creating directories `week8` and `wed` if necessary.
* Copy the file `tokenize.c` from the `/public/classwork/week8/wed`
	directory.

In the file `tokenize.c`, fill the code needed for the `TODO`. After you have
filled in the correct code, compiling and running your program should look like
this.

```
[p19t655@csci112 wed]$ gcc tokenize.c -Wall
[p19t655@csci112 wed]$ ./a.out
Bozeman is in MT, USA
```

You can run the autograder by running

```
/public/classwork/week8/wed/autograder.sh
```

The file `autograder.txt` will be created with your score.

## Grading turnaround
Final scores will be run at 6am on the due date and scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class meeting.
