## Logistics
* Due: Wednesday, August 30th AoE.
* **If you want to see the results of the autograder so that you can check that you will get full credit**: create the directory `csci112_fall2023/classwork/week2/wed`.
	You  don't need to put anything in it. But that's the only place that the
	autograder knows to put your file. You can still get full credit even
	without doing this, but you won't get the preliminary results.
* Submission instructions: make sure that the required directory
	(`csci112_spring2023`) is in your home directory, that it is a git
	repository, and that it has a commit with the tag `my_first_tag`.
* Deadline reminder: after the deadline passes, you cannot earn any points for
	this assignment.

## Outside resources

On this assignment, there are no restrictions on the use of outside resources
for help in any way, including use of AI tools like ChatGPT.

## Learning outcomes
* Get your `git` repository set up and practice making a tagged commit.

## Assignment

* Log in to the server.
* In your home directory, navigate to your `csci112_spring2023` directory, or
	create it if it doesn't not exist. Note
	that you must match this directory name exactly.
* Follow the instructions from the [git lecture notes](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-fall-2023/lectures/lecture2/) to initialize a git
	repository.
* Follow the instructions from the [git lecture notes](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci112-spring-2023/lectures/lecture2/) to add all changes,
	commit, and tag the current snapshot of your repository as `my_first_tag`.

## Grading turnaround
Final scores will be run at 6am on the due date and scores will be
uploaded to D2L by the next class meeting.
