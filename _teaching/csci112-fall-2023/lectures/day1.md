## Questions

* What is different from the last time this was taught? *

*In class, I mentioned that the labs have autograders and that we have in-class
quizzes. I also added more labs and removed some larger programming
assignments.*

* how best to prepare for class quizzes

*My plan is for the quizzes to be easy enough that if you are doing the
classwork and labs, you should get close to 100% even without spending extra
time studying. If you aren't able to do the classwork or labs without
significant help, whether that's from humans or from Googling/using generative
AI, then you should review the lectures and consider getting extra help.*

* are quizzes on computer or paper? **

*Paper.*

* can this be an online only class? *

*Grade-wise, you only need to be in class for the quizzes, and in fact, you
could not take any of the quizzes and just take the final instead. Most people
will have a better chance of succeeding in the class by coming to lecture, but
it is possible to do it all online.*

* what does the homework look like

*Homework (that is, labs) will be programming projects in C.*

* do we use an IDE? *

*Nope, we use the text editor `vim`.*

* Is C still a relevant language to learn?

*Yes! Not only is it useful for understanding how computers really
work, it is also frequently used in the real world. Most operating systems
(e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Linux), and their mobile variants, are at least partially written in C. C is also
frequently used in resource-constrained environments, such as in embedded
systems, because it is very bare-bones and doesn't use as much additional
memory as languages like Python and Java.*

* What makes C unique compared to java/python?

*In class, I mentioned that we can directly manipulate memory in C, unlike in
Java and Python, and that it's not object oriented. There are a lot more
differences, though! I'll just list a few. C has pointers. C is compiled (Java
is too, but a bit differently) whereas Python is interpreted.*

* Will 7th edition of textbook work?

*I think so! Just look in the index or table of contents to find the topics
that we cover.*

* are there contingencies in case there is another hack?

*I hadn't planned any, but my plan now would be to spend some time getting
everyone set up to run C on their laptops if we had another hack.*

* why is it AoE timezone? **

*In my research field, most conferences have deadlines in the AoE timezone, so
it just feels natural to me now. Plus, I assume we have some late-night workers
in this class, so I want them to have the opportunity to finish the assignments.*

* is the Linux server available off campus?

*Yep! You can access it from anywhere as long as you have internet access.*

* what's up with the optional final/labs?

*Labs are optional because many students will be able to complete the lab
assignments without additional help. Your quiz grade will be the maximum of
your average quiz grade over the six in-class quizzes, or your final grade.
This means that if you are happy with your quiz grade, you do not need to take
the final.*
