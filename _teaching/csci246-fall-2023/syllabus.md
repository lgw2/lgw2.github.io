## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: M 171Q or M 165Q.
COREQUISITE: CSCI 132. This course covers logic, discrete probability, recurrence relations, Boolean algebra, sets, relations, counting, functions, maps, Big-O notation, proof techniques including induction, and proof by contradiction.

## Course Info

This course meets for lectures on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
4:10pm-5pm in Reid Hall 105. Lectures will be recorded and available afterward if you
would like to rewatch them. We will use
Discord as the primary method of course communication, and all course
information will be posted on this website or on the Discord server; D2L will
be used *only* for grading.

In an ideal world, your participation in this course would look like this:
* Before lecture, skim the recommended reading (about 15 minutes per lecture).
* Attend lecture, taking notes and asking questions as you have them (about 50 minutes per lecture).
* Attend an optional tutorial section and/or office hours (about 1 hour per
	week).
* Complete the homework assignments to get independent practice developing
	proofs and writing them up clearly (about 3 hours each most weeks).
* Reference the textbook, lecture notes, and lecture videos, and attend
	instructor office hours, use tutoring services, or visit the CS Success
	center as needed.

## Course Resources

### Textbook

*Connecting Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science* by David Liben-Nowell. A free PDF version of the book is available [here](https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/book/). The physical book is about $80 and is available in the bookstore if you prefer that.

### Problem solving tips

Check out [this document](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci246-spring-2023/homework/tips.pdf) for tips on how to come up with your proofs, specific
tips for homework assignments in this class, and strategies for getting the
homework assignments done. This document is a work in progress and may be
updated throughout the semester.

### Lecture extra notes

We may go over some notation and definitions quickly during lecture. If you're
feeling rusty on your math notation, check out the [lecture extras](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci246-spring-2023/lectures/extras.pdf) document.
It'll be updated throughout the course with notes for the day's lecture, and if
I get a lot of questions about something from a day's lecture, I'll put more
notes in about that, too.

### Course assistants

We have two course assistants for this course: Adiesha Liyanage and Jasmine
Vang. Jasmine will be available in the [CS Student Success Center](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html) (Barnard 259)
from 9am-11am Mondays and Adiesha will be available 9am-11am Fridays.

### Lecture videos

Lectures are recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos are linked in the schedule above, or you can access them
through the [Panopto folder](https://montana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=faf37315-500c-4fcd-abe6-af8e015819e9).

### Instructor office hours

My office hours are Thursdays and Fridays, 3-4:30 in the CS Success Center
(Barnard 259). You can also contact me on Discord to set up a
different meeting time, or drop by my office (Barnard 359) if my door is open.
You can find office hours for all CS faculty [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

### Computer Science Success Center
There are free tutors available in Barnard 259. More information [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html).

### Discord server

All course communication will be through our course Discord server. See D2L
announcement for link. Please [change your nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to your full name (first
and last). Additionally, I suggest managing your notification settings. Check
out Discord's [Notification Settings 101 page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101) to get started. You may also need to manage the application notification settings on your device.

## Course outcomes
By engaging with this course through attending lectures and completing
assignments, at the end of this course, students should:
* be comfortable reading and using mathematical terminology around sets,
	functions, propositional and predicate logic, asymptotic notation,
	recursion, and graphs;
* be comfortable reading and writing mathematical proofs using the following
	methods: direct proofs, proofs by counterexample, proofs by construction,
	proofs by contradiction, proofs by contrapositive, and proofs by induction;
* have improved their problem solving and critical thinking skills, such as:
    * using examples, counter-examples, diagrams, simpler cases, similar
		problems, etc., to better understand a mathematical statement,
	* recognizing a broken proof or a false start and using them to find a new
		result or approach,
	* thinking critically about which proof paradigm is most appropriate.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 12 weekly drills (lowest three dropped): 8%
* 7 problem sets (lowest two dropped): 62%
* 3 quizzes (including final): 30%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are three ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), post in the `#errors-in-course-material` channel on Discord. I will decide whether
it's truly an error and not a duplicate. If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Additional work throughout the semester

Since two problem sets and three drills are dropped, if you do additional
problem sets and drills beyond those that count, they may
be counted as a bonus. There may be additional problems that you can complete
for bonus as well. The maximum bonus you may earn from this is 3 points out of 100 for
the semester.

Here's how this bonus category will be computed. First, recall that you can only earn three points
total, even if you got more than three total. The following things sum up for
your bonus score:
* 1 point: any extra (more than 5) problem set turned in with a score of 50% or
	more;
* 1/2 point: any in-class bonus activity or bonus question on a
	homework completed correctly (these are all marked in D2L grades under the "bonus"
	category)
* 1/4 point: any extra (more than 10) drill completed with a score of 50% or more.

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 75% or more of the class completes the mid-semester course survey (through
D2L), whole class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation
(through the university system).

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignments; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Discord, on D2L,  and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments are due on their due date by the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)
	timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe), which is 6 hours behind Bozeman (Actually, it's only 5 hours behind during standard time, but we'll go with 6 hours behind at all times). This means that the real due
	date is 6am the following day. If you submit labs and programs  within 24 hours of the due date, you get 25% off of whatever score you earn. If you
	submit within two days of the due date you get 50% off.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* You can submit as many times as you would like; only your last submission will be
	graded.
* Drills cannot be submitted late.

### Missed quiz policy

Any conflicts with a quiz must be discussed with me prior to missing the quiz.
I follow University policy on makeups, which allows that serious illness or a
serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation. Most
other reasons (employment conflict, travel plans) are not valid.

### Collaboration policy
On all assignments, you may:
* Discuss problems and approaches with your peers.

You may not:
* Copy your peers' proofs or write-ups of solutions to homework problems, even
	if you worked together to develop solutions.
* Use the internet to search for or solicit approaches or ideas.
* Post the assignments or quizzes for this course on the internet.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

## Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is January 31st. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is February 7th. The last day to drop with a W grade
(instructor and advisor approval required) is April 19th. See the full
[add/drop schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/add_drop_schedule.html)
for more information.
