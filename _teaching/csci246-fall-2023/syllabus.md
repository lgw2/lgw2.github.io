## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: M 171Q or M 165Q.
COREQUISITE: CSCI 132. This course covers logic, discrete probability, recurrence relations, Boolean algebra, sets, relations, counting, functions, maps, Big-O notation, proof techniques including induction, and proof by contradiction.

## Course Info

This course meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
4:10pm-5pm in Reid Hall 105. Our course meetings will be a combination of
lecture and in-class group and solo activities. We will use
Discord as the primary method of course communication, and all course
information will be posted on this website or on the Discord server; D2L will
be used *only* for recording grades.
Lectures will be recorded and available afterward if you
would like to rewatch them; however, in-class activities make up 10% of your
grade so it is in your best interest to attend class.


## Course Resources

### Textbook

The content in this course is based off of
*Connecting Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science* by David Liben-Nowell. A free PDF version of the book is available [here](https://cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dln/book/). The physical book is about $80 and is available in the bookstore if you prefer that.

### Problem solving tips

Check out [this document](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci246-spring-2023/homework/tips.pdf) for tips on how to come up with your proofs, specific
tips for homework assignments in this class, and strategies for getting the
homework assignments done. This document is a work in progress and may be
updated throughout the semester.

### Course assistants

Braeden is our course assistant. His office hours are Thursday 9-10 and Friday
12-1 in the CS Success Center, Barnard 259. You can contact him at
braedensopp@msu.montana.edu.

### Lecture videos

Lectures are recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://montana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=a2e302c9-69f1-4a36-89a0-b05101553b63).

### Instructor office hours

My office hours are 5:10-6:30pm (right after class) on Mondays and 9:30-11am on
Thursdays in the CS Success Center
(Barnard 259). You can also contact me on Discord to set up a
different meeting time, make an appointment via my [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2hjUnXFy55TwZXrSyiG53_QoYEz592Vki7k0zvjmu2eWGXBG6x9c6zYfpe7JNylzyUeQYrMp0c), or drop by my office (Barnard 359) if my door is open.
You can find office hours for all CS faculty [here](https://www.cs.montana.edu/office-hours.html).

### Computer Science Success Center

### Discord server

All course communication will be through our course Discord server. See D2L
announcement for link. Please [change your nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to your full name (first
and last). Additionally, I suggest managing your notification settings. Check
out Discord's [Notification Settings 101 page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/215253258-Notifications-Settings-101) to get started. You may also need to manage the application notification settings on your device.

## Course outcomes
By engaging with this course through attending lectures and completing
assignments, at the end of this course, students should:
* be comfortable reading and using mathematical terminology around sets,
	functions, propositional and predicate logic, asymptotic notation,
	recursion, and graphs;
* be comfortable reading and writing mathematical proofs using the following
	methods: direct proofs, proofs by counterexample, proofs by construction,
	proofs by contradiction, proofs by contrapositive, and proofs by induction;
* have improved their problem solving and critical thinking skills, such as:
    * using examples, counter-examples, diagrams, simpler cases, similar
		problems, etc., to better understand a mathematical statement,
	* recognizing a broken proof or a false start and using them to find a new
		result or approach,
	* thinking critically about which proof paradigm is most appropriate.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 11 homework assignments (lowest score dropped): 50%
* 3 quizzes (including final): 40%
* In-class assignments (1 point for participating in each one, for up to 10
	points total; there will be at least 15 total): 10%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are three ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), post in the `#errors-in-course-material` channel on Discord. I will decide whether
it's truly an error and not a duplicate. If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Participation in additional in-class assignments

Because the max score you can receive for the in-class assignment category is
10, but there will be at least 15 in-class assignments, any additional in-class
assignment will be added as a half point to your score at the end of the
semester. The max points you can earn from this bonus is 2.

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 75% or more of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Late assignment policies
To run a course of this size we cannot accommodate individual requests for
extensions on assignments; therefore, we have strict rules for when assignments
are due, but have some leeway built in. Please read the bullet points below carefully,
respect the policy, and *get help early if
you are having any problems.* We want you to succeed!

* You are responsible for any announcements about assignments  made in class, on Discord, on D2L, and here
	on the course website.
* All assignments are due on their due date by the [Anywhere on Earth (AoE)
	timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe), which is 6 hours behind Bozeman (Actually, it's only 5 hours behind during standard time, but we'll go with 6 hours behind at all times). This means that the real due
	date is 6am the following day. If you submit within 24 hours of the due date, you get 25% off of whatever score you earn. If you
	submit within two days of the due date you get 50% off.
	Otherwise, no points are possible.
* You can submit as many times as you would like; only your last submission will be
	graded.

### Missed quiz policy

Any conflicts with a quiz must be discussed with me prior to missing the quiz.
I follow University policy on makeups, which allows that serious illness or a
serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation. Most
other reasons (employment conflict, travel plans) are not valid.

### Missed in-class assignment policy

If you know that you will miss class consistently, please come talk to me or
send me a Discord message ASAP and we will work something out.

### Collaboration policy
On all homework assignments, you may:
* Discuss problems and approaches with your peers.

You may not:
* Copy your peers' proofs or write-ups of solutions to homework problems, even
	if you worked together to develop solutions.
* Use the internet to search for or solicit approaches or ideas to assigned
	homework problems.
* Use generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to search for approaches or ideas to
	assigned homework problems.
* Post the assignments or quizzes for this course on the internet.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

## Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is September 6th. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is September 13th. The last day to drop with a W grade
(instructor and advisor approval required) is November 15th. See the full
[add/drop schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/add_drop_schedule.html)
for more information.
