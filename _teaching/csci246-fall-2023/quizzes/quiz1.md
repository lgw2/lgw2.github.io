title: "Quiz 1"

The first quiz
will cover everything we have learned in the course through functions and
pigeonhold principle.

The quiz will have four parts.
1. Given some claims and (proposed) proofs of the claims, you will need to decide whether the proofs are valid or not. If
   they are not valid, you will need to write about one sentence explaining
   why.
2. Construct some truth tables for compound propositions and translate an
   English sentence into a fully quantified statement of predicate logic (or
   vice versa).
3. Answer some drill-style questions. Many of these will in fact be questions from the
   drills.
4. Write a proof that we saw in class or on a homework. You will be provided some scaffolding to
   get you started.
