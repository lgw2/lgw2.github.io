The second quiz
will cover everything we have learned in the course through probability and
counting, but will focus on the topics we covered since the last quiz:
relations, proof by mathematical induction, graphs, and probability and
counting.

The quiz will have four parts.
1. Given a relation, identify which properties it satisfies, whether it is any
   type of order or equivalence relation, and if it is an equivalence relation,
   its equivalence classes.
2. Fill in the missing parts of a proof by mathematical induction.
3. Answer some drill-style or short answer questions on probability.
3. Answer some drill-style or short answer questions on graphs.
