The third quiz
will cover everything we have learned in the course, but will focus algorithm analysis. Note that algorithm analysis and big O deal with
many of the topics from earlier in the course: relations, functions,
propositions,
predicates, sets, and of course proofs and thus all of the proof techniques.
Thus, while the questions will focus on big O and algorithm analysis, you will
want to be familiar with the ideas from earlier in the course.

The quiz will have five parts.
1. Given some propositions about big O and their proposed proofs, identify
   whether the proof is valid or not.
2. Given a function, prove that it is big O of another function using the
   defintion.
3. Given an algorithm in pseudocode form, give a proposed function counting the
   number of primitive operations, and the tightest big O (i.e., big theta)
   runtime of the function.
4. Given a recursive algorithm, use a recurrence relation to give its runtime.
5. Drill-style questions on the analysis of algorithms.


You may bring a 3-by-5 index card of notes (front and back) to reference during
the quiz. Otherwise, no other resources are allowed.
