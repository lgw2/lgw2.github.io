title: "Survey 1"

Surveys are anonymous and will be on Brightspace. They can be done on your own time. The idea is to
give feedback on the course. You should be able to complete the survey in under
5 minutes if you like, or you can take longer and give more feedback.

If 75% or more of the class completes the survey, everyone will receive one
bonus point in the class.
