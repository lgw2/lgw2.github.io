## Logistics
* Due: Thursday, August 25th anywhere on earth (6am Friday). (Penalties from [the
	syllabus](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/csci132-fall-2022/syllabus/)
	apply if you turn it in any later.)
* Submission instructions: send a message to Lucy on Discord. The assignment on
	D2L will be used for reporting your grade only.


## Learning outcomes
* Introduce yourself to the professor.
* Make sure you understand the syllabus.
* Set up your system to run Java, or make a plan to get help if you can't.

## Assignment

* [Change your Discord nickname](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20the,new%20nickname%20of%20your%20choice!) to whatever you prefer to be called,
   *including last name*. For example, if I was a student, I would put Lucy
   Williams, because my given first name is Lucia but I usually use Lucy. If
   you would like, you may also put the pronouns that you would like others to
   use for you.

In a direct message to Lucy, answer the following questions.

* What previous programming courses have you taken, and/or what other
   programming experience do you have?
* What time and day of the week are labs due? What time and day of the week
   are programs due?
* Were you able to install Java and the IDE of your choice? If not, what is the
	next step you will take to get help? (For example, post in the
	`#java-setup` channel on Discord, visit the Computer Science Success
	Center, ask a friend.)
* Someone asks you for help with a lab because they are getting an error they
   don't understand. Which of the following are okay according to the course
   policies? (a) For them to send you
   a copy of their code so you can run it on your own computer to help them undersatnd they error message. (b)
   For them to sit with you and have them run the code on their own computer
   while you talk them through debugging it (without sending you a
   copy of their code). (c) To get on a video call with them, have them share
   their screen, and show their code to you while you talk them through
   debugging it (again without sending you a copy).
* *Optional:* are you able to bring a laptop to class to work on small
	   programming exercises?
* *Optional:* do you anticipate any barriers to your success in this course
	that you would like to share with me?
