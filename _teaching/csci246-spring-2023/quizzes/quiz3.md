The third quiz
will focus on everything since the second quiz: relations, graphs, and
probability. ~~However, a few questions will relate to content from the
previous parts of the course.~~

The quiz will have four questions. All will be  worth 20 points, except the drill-style
questions, which will be worth 40. Here is what the questions will cover:
1. Given a relation, determine which of the 5 properties it satisfies and whether
   it is an equivalence relation or partial/total order.
2. Given some graphs, decide whether they satisfy certain graph properties.
   Given some graph properties, give example graphs that satisfy them.
3. Count the size of some sets, give the probability of an outcome or event,
   etc.
4. Answer some drill-style questions. Many of these will in fact be questions from the
   drills.
