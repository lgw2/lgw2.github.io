The third quiz
will focus on everything since the second quiz: relations, graphs, and
probability. However, a few questions will relate to content from the
previous parts of the course.

The quiz will have six questions. All will be  worth 15 points, except the drill-style
questions, which will be worth 25. Here is what the questions will cover:
1. Given two proofs, determine whether they are valid or not. If they are not
   valid, give a reason.
2. Given a relation, determine which of the 5 properties it satisfies, whether
   it is an equivalence relation or partial/total order.
3. Given some graphs, decide whether they satisfy certain graph properties.
   Given some graph properties, give example graphs that satisfy them.
4. Count the size of some sets, give the probability of an outcome or event,
   etc.
5. Given some psuedocode, give a function expressing the number of primitive
   operations in terms of the input size, and give the "best" (i.e., tightest)
   big O bound on the function.
6. Answer some drill-style questions. Many of these will in fact be questions from the
   drills.
