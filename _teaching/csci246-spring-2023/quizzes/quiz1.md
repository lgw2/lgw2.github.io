Quizzes will be on Brightspace and can be done on your own time. You can also
come to the lecture classroom during the day of the quiz and take the quiz there so that
you can get immediate help from a TA if a question is unclear or you have any
technical difficulties.

The first quiz
will cover everything we have learned in the course through the lecture on Monday, September 26th.
Once you start the quiz, you have one hour to complete it. It will be open from
8am on Friday, September 30th until 6am on Sunday, October 2nd.
A practice quiz will be available by Monday, 9/26.

For the  quiz, you may access a lot of resources:
* Any of the course videos
* Anything in the course Discord
* Anything linked from the course webpage (including the code linked from
	the lectures, the Java documentation, and the Runestone Interactive
	textbook)
* The course textbook (Data Structures and Algorithms in Java)
* Any of your assignments or code you have written in class or on your own to
	practice

Finally, you can write and run your own Java code to check your answers.

You may *not* ask anyone else for help or Google anything.
