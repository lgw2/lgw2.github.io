title: "Quiz 1"
---

The first quiz
will cover everything we have learned in the course through predicate logic (so
no functions).

The quiz will have four questions.
1. For two proofs, you will need to decide whether they are valid or not. If
   they are not valid, you will need to write about one sentence explaining
   why.
2. Construct some truth tables for compound propositions.
3. Answer some drill-style questions. Many of these will in fact be questions from the
   drills.
4. Write a proof that we saw in class. You will be provided some scaffolding to
   get you started.
