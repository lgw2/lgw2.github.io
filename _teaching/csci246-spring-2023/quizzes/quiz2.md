The second quiz
will focus on everything since the first quiz, so functions, pigeon hole
principle, proofs by induction and recursively defined structures, big O, and
worst-case runtime analysis.

The quiz will have four questions.
1. Write a simple proof that $f(n)=O(g(n))$ for a given $f(n)$ and $g(n)$.
2. Write a simple proof using mathematical induction.
3. Answer some drill-style questions. Many of these will in fact be questions from the
   drills.
4. Given some psuedocode, give a function expressing the number of primitive
   operations in terms of the input size, and give the "best" big O
