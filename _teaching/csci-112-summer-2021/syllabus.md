## Course resources

All textbooks will be optional for this course.


### Office hours

### Slack workspace
We'll be using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for *all* course communication
(except about grades or other sensitive information). It is very important that
you [join the Slack
workspace]()
and check it every day of the course to keep up with announcements and to get
help when you need it. There are [plenty of videos
online](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+use+slack) that
can help you use Slack; most importantly, [you should customize your
notification settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfkX8oTalDg)!


### Visualizing your code
You can paste your C code into the tool [here](http://pythontutor.com/c.html) and see what executes with every step.
*Note: I have used this extensively while teaching Python, but this is my first
time using it to teach C. If you encounter anything fishy, let me know.*

### Checking your work

### Writing C code

## Collaboration policy

## Diversity statement
Montana State University's campuses are committed to
providing an environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member
of its community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon
race, color, religion, national origin, creed, service in the uniformed
services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran's status, sex, age,
political ideas, marital or family status, pregnancy, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
orientation. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working,
and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human
dignity and the positive connection among all people at our University. Acts of
discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic
violence, stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this
policy.
