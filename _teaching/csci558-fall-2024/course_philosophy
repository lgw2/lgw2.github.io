## Course philosophy

Bioinformatics is a truly exciting subject at the intersection of very
different fields. It is well worth learning, but because the material is
difficult, we will want to use the best approaches to learning that we can.

Since 1984, we have known of the [2 Sigma Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem):
students achieve a two
standard deviation improvement in learning performance when they are tutored
individually rather than taught in a standard lecture. The reason for this difference
is that students learn in different ways and at different paces,
but the traditional lecture accommodates only one way of learning and only one
pace. Most instructors do not have the time or resources to do anything
different, but in this course, we will use an interactive textbook and operate
in a somewhat "flipped" model, where students read and complete assessments in
the interactive text before class time. This allows for class time to be used
not for transmissive lectures but rather for in-depth guided discussions with
students working together in small groups.

Although active learning classrooms have been proven to be more effective for learning than traditional
lecture environments, students [sometimes feel that they would be learning more in a lecture](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1821936116). This may be exacerbated by the fact that our pre-class assignments will
prepare us to confront more advanced
ideas in discussion and problem-solving sessions during class, which will likely feel challenging.
It is precisely in these moments of challenge that true learning takes place. I
ask that you stay open to this challenge, and I hope you enjoy the learning
that we will be able to do in this course.
