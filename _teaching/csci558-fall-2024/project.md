## Final project

### Overview

### Deliverables

### Important Dates

### Grading

Overall, your project will be graded according to the following percentages:
* Final essay (50%). Your final essay will be graded based on both the quality
    of your scientific work and the written quality of the essay.
* Presentation (30%). Your presentation will also be judged based on scientific
    merit and your ability to present this scientific work intelligently and
    clearly to an audience of your peers who are unfamiliar with this work.
* Other deliverables (20%). To ensure you are completing the project in a
    timely fashion, we expect you to complete all other deliverables. Each
    of the five other deliverables will be worth 4% of your total score.

#### Project guidelines

Here are some guidelines for each component of the project to keep in mind.
This is not a rubric (i.e., we will not grade your project only according to
these guidelines), but things that will ensure that you are on track.
