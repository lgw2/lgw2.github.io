## Catalog description

This is a co-convened course which for some reason has different course numbers for the undergraduate and graduate levels.

3 Credits. Designed for attendance by both computer scientists and biologists. The course will explore the interdisciplinary nature at the juncture of the two fields. Students will be introduced to bioinformatics (emphasis: computational genomics), with exposure to fundamental problems, algorithms, and tools in the field. This includes a basic introduction to genomics, along with in-depth coverage of algorithms and methods relevant to modern computational genomics, including: biological sequence alignment, sequence database homology search, and phylogeny inference. The programming expectations are limited for a 400/500-level computer science course, but at least one semester of a programming-intensive course is required.

## Course info

This course meets in Education 241 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
11am-12:20pm.

Class time will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and active problem solving, both as
individuals and as groups.

## Course resources

### Textbook

The textbook for this course is Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning
Approach by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner.

### Lecture videos

Lectures will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in here TBD.

### Discord

TBD

## Grading

Note: if your final project from this course ends up being published in a
peer-reviewed conference or journal, you will automatically get an A+. This
rule can be applied retroactively for several years after the course ends.

You will be graded on the following:
* Programming assignments: 20%
* Software challenges: 10%
* Weekly writeups: 10%
* Weekly quizzes: 10%
* Participation: 10%
* Final exam: 20%
* Final project: 20%

Your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in the `errors-in-course-material` Discord channel.
If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy

TBD.
