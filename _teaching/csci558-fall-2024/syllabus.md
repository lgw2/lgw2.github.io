## Catalog description

This is a co-convened course with different course numbers for the undergraduate and graduate levels.

3 Credits. Designed for attendance by both computer scientists and biologists. The course will explore the interdisciplinary nature at the juncture of the two fields. Students will be introduced to bioinformatics (emphasis: computational genomics), with exposure to fundamental problems, algorithms, and tools in the field. This includes a basic introduction to genomics, along with in-depth coverage of algorithms and methods relevant to modern computational genomics, including: biological sequence alignment, sequence database homology search, and phylogeny inference. The programming expectations are limited for a 400/500-level computer science course, but at least one semester of a programming-intensive course is required.

## Basic course info

This course meets in Education 241 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
11am-12:20pm.

Class time will be a mix of lecture, discussion, and active problem solving, both as
individuals and as groups. Before class, students will read the textbook
and complete some pre-class exercises. To close out each course topic, we will
have a short quiz and an open-ended activity done in groups during class to
apply what we've learned.

Students will also complete a larger group project on a bioinformatics topic of
their choice.

During class, I will ask that you close laptops and except
when they are needed to follow along with a coding demonstration or for group
work.

## Course resources

### Textbook

The textbook for this course is *Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning
Approach* by Phillip Compeau and Pavel Pevzner. You will be required to purchase the
online version of the book for $29.95 to complete pre-class programming exercises;
purchasing the physical book is optional. Follow [this link](https://cogniterra.org/course/465/promo) to purchase the book and gain access to our course's assignments. Please use your UM email to register an account.

### Class videos

Lecture periods will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, and
in-class participation will be a key to your learning, so please come
to class when you can. Videos can be found in [here](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=a01a54a5-8239-4b2b-8d19-b1d40102d5bc).

### Book's lecture videos

The authors of our textbook created [free lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/@bioinfalgorithms/playlists) to accompany the text.
You are not required to watch these, but if you find them helpful, please do!

### Discord

Please join the UM Computer Science Discord to keep up with announcements and
to ask questions. Instructions can be found on
Canvas.

## Course help hours (aka office hours)

You will have some pre-class programming activities due the afternoon before
most class periods. You can come get help from the instructor or work with your peers on
Monday and Wednesdays from 1-2:30 in the CS Conference Room (Social Sciences
402).

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* Pre-class assignments: 20%
* In-class worksheets: 10%
* Quizzes: 15%
* Final exam: 15%
* Final project: 30%

This accounts for 90% of your grade. For students enrolled in 451, the remaining
10% will come from attending lectures (one lecture missed automatically
dropped; after that, please let me know beforehand to have a lecture absence
excused). For 558 students, it will come from
an individual additional component to the final group project.

Your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in the `#errors-in-course-material` Discord channel.
If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy

Collaboration will be an important part of this course, including the use of
outside resources such as web search and the use of generative AI tools. In the
first week, we will come up with course policies regarding collaboration and
the use of outside resources.
