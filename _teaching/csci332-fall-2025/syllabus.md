## Catalog description

3 Credits.
Prereq., CSCI 232 and M 225 or consent of instr. Algorithm design, analysis, and correctness. Commonly used algorithms including searching and sorting, string search, dynamic programming, branch and bound, graph algorithms, and parallel algorithms. Introduction to NP-complete problems.

## Course outcomes

In previous parts of the computer science curriculum, students have been exposed to various computational problems and
have seen solutions (algorithms) to solve them. In this course, we continue that journey, with additional emphasis on more complex (and
therefore more real-world) computational problems and advanced algorithm design techniques.

After completing this course, a student should be able to:
* translate natural-language descriptions of computational problems into precisely formulated computational problems
* recognize various real-world computational problems as instances of known computational problems
* identify valid inputs and correct outputs to computational problems
* trace through algorithm execution
* argue the correctness of an algorithm using a variety of proof techniques (direct proof, proof by induction, etc.)
* give counterexamples showing that an algorithm is incorrect
* correctly describe an algorithm's runtime from a variety of practical viewpoints
* understand a variety of algorithm design techniques (greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, etc.)
* understand fundamental differences between classes of computational problems (P vs. NP)

## Pedagogical strategies

In order to achieve the course outcomes, this course uses a variety of pedagogical strategies:
* frequent feedback: students can check their understanding of the course material through autograded weekly exercises (PrairieLearn assignments),
weekly written homework, and weekly quizzes.
* group problem solving
* development of students' own "inner computer": ability to verify correctness, runtime, and other properties
of algorithms and computational topics through their own reasoning processes, rather than relying on outside sources
of authority such as textbooks, AI tools, autograders, compilers, or human authority figures like instructors.

This course will aim to provide you all of the resources to learn data structure and algorithms,
but in the end, I believe that you must build your own understandings of these concepts:

> I doubt very much if it is possible to teach anyone to understand anything, that is to say, to see how various parts of it relate to all the other parts, to have a model of the structure in one’s mind. We can give other people names, and lists, but we cannot give them our mental structures; they must build their own. — John Holt

## Course info

This course meets in Social Sciences 362 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from
10-10:50am.

Class time will be a mix of lecture and active problem solving, both as
individuals and as groups. Every week we will have an interactive, auto-graded assignment via [PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/183466) due before class Friday and a short quiz during class on Friday. We will then have a short written homework assignment due on Monday via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1044382).

During class time, I will ask that you refrain from using all laptops and cell
phones, except when they are useful for accessing information during group
problem solving sessions. I highly recommend that you use paper or a tablet for
notetaking, but please let me know if you require an exception to
this rule.

After we have had time to establish norms around laptop and cell phone use in class (perhaps 1-2 weeks),
you will lose your participation points for the day if you are using them when they are prohibited.

## Course resources

### Textbook

The textbook for this course is Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva
Tardos. New copies of the textbook are available in the bookstore, but you may
also obtain the textbook in other ways. Either first or second edition is fine. Please let me know
if you want access to the textbook but do not have it.

### Lecture videos

Lectures will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=1e50fec7-689a-4362-9868-b33e01192316).

### Resources from other courses

Most CS departments teach a course similar to this one, and many use the same textbook that we do. I link
lecture videos and other materials from other similar courses here in case you find them useful:

* Davidson College Fall 2022 Analysis of Algorithms [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgPbN3w-ia_MzatWGASfuPg9hon_Fsz1V)

### Discord

Please join the UM Computer Science Discord to keep up with announcements and
to ask questions. Instructions can be found on
Canvas.

### Teaching and learning assistants

We are lucky to have both a teaching Assistant (TA) and a learning assistant
(LA) in this course. Our TA Onila is a graduate student in computer science and
will be assisting with in-class activities, outside of course help, and
grading. Our learning assistant Kyle will assist with group problem solving sessions and other
in-class activities and hold a weekly course help hour.


## Course help hours (aka office hours)

Instructor course help hours will be Monday 2-3pm and Thursday 10-11am in Social Sciences 402 (the CS conference room).
No course help hours Monday, August 25th, but please DM Lucy on Discord if you have a question or would like to set up a Zoom meeting.

Learning assistant Kyle will hold a course help hours on Wednesday 2-3 and Friday 11-12.

### Homework submission

#### PrairieLearn assignments

Before class on Fridays, you will have auto-graded problem sets on a platform
called PrairieLearn.  You can try these problems as many times as you would like
until you get the right answer, because they automatically generate new
variations of the problem each time. For some assignments, you will need to
complete multiple variations of the same problem to get full credit. Make sure
you look at the "Total points" value on the right-hand side of the screen.  If
you are able to complete the PrairieLearn assignment for the week by yourself,
you should be well-prepared for Friday's quiz. However, if you are unable to
answer the questions on your own, you do not have a complete understanding of an
important concept that will likely appear on the Friday quiz. (Or the question
is poorly phrased or has a bug--this is always a possibility and do not hesitate
to post in `#errors-in-course-materials` if you think this is the case.) Try to
identify where your understanding breaks down and formulate a question you can
either answer for yourself using resources like the textbook, lecture
notes/videos, other online resources, or ask your question in the `#questions`
channel in the Discord or attend course help hours. 

You can access
the PrairieLearn problem sets [here](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/183466). You
should select either the "Sign in with Google" or the "Sign in with Microsoft"
option. You can log in
with any Google or Microsoft email account; your UM email will work as a
Microsoft account if you prefer.

In assigning homework like this one, I am placing emphasis on mastery. The idea is to keep doing questions until you master the underlying concept or method. Once you do, you should be able to answer these questions very quickly.

The way this works in PrairieLearn is that each question has a value, a point total, and a point maximum. If you answer a question correctly, two things happen:

* The point total increases by the value, until you reach the point maximum.
* The value increases (2x, 3x, 4x, etc.)

If you answer a question incorrectly, one thing happens:

* The value goes back to what it was originally (1x)

This system rewards repeated correct answers, which tend to demonstrate mastery. There is no penalty (other than resetting the value) for answering a question incorrectly, so don't be afraid to submit an answer. Similarly, don't be afraid to keep doing a question after you reach the point maximum - your point total will never go down!

#### Written homework

Written homework will be due on Mondays [anywhere on Earth](https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth), i.e., 6am on Tuesday morning.
Submit your written homework on Gradescope. Go to [gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com) and sign up using entry code `5RN3K2`.

Written homework will generally consist of one or two proof or algorithm-development related problems, designed to push your understanding
of the material covered in the previous week. 

You are encouraged to write your homework using LaTex, a typesetting program
that is popular in computer science research. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an online LaTeX
compiler, and I've provided a [homework template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/knwmhrgkkqqj#9a5edd) that you can use to write
up your homework solutions.

A grading rubric will be provided with every homework assignment. Note that every problem will require you to provide citations, as described below.

##### Collaboration policy

You may use *any* resource available to you on the written homework, as
long as you write up your answers in your own words and properly cite your
sources. Some examples of resources you might use:

* other students in the class
* other students not in the class
* other instructors
* textbooks or online notes
* anything you find on the internet
* ChatGPT or other AI tools

The only resources you may use without citation are our course textbook,
Algorithm Design by Kleinberg and Tardos, our posted lecture slides, our
in-class or Discord discussions, and office hours discussions. To help you properly cite your sources,
you will be required to provide citations on all homework questions, and questions without citations (or a note that no sources were used)
will receive 0 points.

Please ask if you have questions about how to properly cite a source or a
collaborator.

Additionally, please ask if you have questions about what it means to write up answers in your own words.
We will be following up with students who we believe have copied their homework answers from outside sources, even if a citation is provided.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 45% exams: three in-class exams throughout the semester, worth 15% each. The final is cumulative but optional and can be taken to
boost your exam grade.
* 30% weekly quizzes
* 10% written homework
* 10% participation (recorded via attendance)
* 5% PrairieLearn homework

Your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Participation

Your particiapation grade will be based on lecture attendance. You can make up
lecture attendance by attending office hours or in other ways; please contact
Lucy if you need to arrange another way to make up attendance.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement,
etc.), make a post in the `#errors-in-course-material` Discord channel.  If it
is really an error, you get a quarter of a point. Only the first person to post
about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your
100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

You will receive a bonus point for completing the mid-semester course survey and the
end-of-semester course evaluation.
