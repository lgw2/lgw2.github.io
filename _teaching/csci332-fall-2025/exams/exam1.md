You are allowed one 3x5 notecard (or 3x5 piece of paper) of handwritten notes,
both sides.
No other resources. You will have the entire 50 minute class period to complete
it. If you have accommodations and want a low distraction environment and/or
more time, schedule with the testing center ASAP.

Exam 1 will cover everything since the start of class: stable matching,
algorithm analysis, graphs, and Dijkstra's algorithm. It will consist of
questions similar to those on quizzes, Prairie Learn, those written homeworks.

A sample exam will be available by end of day Saturday, September 28. You will
do another sample exam in groups in class on Wednesday, October 1.
