title: "Problem presentations"
---

In order to practice communicating mathematical ideas in-person, we will have a
presentation by a group of about 2 students to start every class during the CS theory
portion of the class, beginning 1/30. The group will choose one of the "to
think about later" problems from the previous day's problem session and present
and explanation and solution to the problem.

A schedule of presenters is available on Moodle.

Both students in the group will receive the same grade. Grades are out of 5
points, as follows:
* 1 point for a correct solution to the problem
* 1 point for staying under time (10 minutes)
* 1 point for approximately equal participation by both partners
* 1 point for providing additional intuition, explanation, or examples beyond
    simply reading/writing the solution
* 1 point for being professional and well-practiced.

On 1/25, Lucy will give an example of a problem presentation from the previous
proplem session.
