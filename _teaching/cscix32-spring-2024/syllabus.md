### Textbook

There is no textbook for this course; however, ...

### Lecture videos

Lectures are recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=dcf4e4db-c07c-4d77-9063-b0f10157fd5d).

## Course outcomes

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 11 homework assignments (lowest score dropped): 50%
* 3 quizzes (including final): 40%
* In-class assignments (1 point for participating in each one, for up to 10
	points total; there will be at least 15 total): 10%

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are three ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), post in the `#errors-in-course-material` channel on Discord. I will decide whether
it's truly an error and not a duplicate. If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy
On all homework assignments, you may:
* Discuss problems and approaches with your peers.

You may not:
* Copy your peers' proofs or write-ups of solutions to homework problems, even
	if you worked together to develop solutions.
* Use the internet to search for or solicit approaches or ideas to assigned
	homework problems.
* Use generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to search for approaches or ideas to
	assigned homework problems.
* Post the assignments or quizzes for this course on the internet.

### Academic misconduct

In line with the [MSU student code of conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#academichonesty), if I or the teaching assistants suspect that you have committed academic misconduct, we will schedule a meeting with you to discuss. If, after the meeting, we believe that you did commit academic misconduct, you will receive a 0 on the assignment and I will submit a report to the Dean of Students. It's just not worth it to cheat in this course.

## Important dates

The last day to drop the course online (with no instructor or advisor approval)
is September 6th. The last day to drop without a W grade (instructor or advisor
approval required) is September 13th. The last day to drop with a W grade

## Diversity statement
Montana State University's campuses are committed to
providing an environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member

services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran's status, sex, age,
political ideas, marital or family status, pregnancy, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
