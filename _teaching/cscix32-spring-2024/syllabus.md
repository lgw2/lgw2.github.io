## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 332.
Advanced algorithm and data structure concepts, including theory, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, parallel algorithms, streaming algorithms, linear programming.

## Course info

This course will have two parts: in the first half, we will work to understand
what is computable and how fast using computer science theory developed in
the 20th century. This will give us a baseline to understand the
contemporary algorithms field and familiarity with the concepts, notation, and
proof styles necessary.
In the second half, we will learn a number of advanced algorithm
concepts and see how they are applied in current algorithms research. This will
be a highly interactive class, and although the material is challenging, I will
try to provide the appropriate level of support and I think students will get a
lot out of the course.

## Course resources

### Moodle

We will use Moodle for course announcements and for homework submission.
Otherwise, all course information will be on this webpage, and any questions
about course logisitcs or content should be asked via [Piazza]().

### Group problem sessions

In the first half of the course, we will be working through concepts in
computer science theory. The best way to understand these concepts is through
practice and discussion. In order to provide you as much support as possible,
I will schedule and lead two weekly problem sessions where we will work through
problems that are similar to the homework that you turn in every Monday. These
are not required, but you can earn some participation points by attending, and
if you attend these problem sessions the homework should be much easier to
complete. Solutions will be shared after the problem sessions
are completed.

In the second half of the class, we will decide how we want to use the group
problem session time.

### Textbook

There is no textbook for this course; notes from various sources will be shared
as needed. However, there are a number of popular textbooks in this field, many
of which are available for free online:
* TODO, fill in

### Lecture videos

Lectures will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=dcf4e4db-c07c-4d77-9063-b0f10157fd5d).

### Piazza discussion

Especially in the first half of the course, you will be working through
problems and I would like you to get help as soon as possible. We will use the
forum [Piazza]() to organize questions and answers.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 20% participation
* 20% homework problems (in theory section)
* 20% problem presentations (in theory section)
* 20% paper summaries (in algorithms section)
* 20% paper presentations (in algorithms section)

Note that there are *no tests!*

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in Piazza (in TODO way).
If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy

On all homework assignments, you may work in groups of up to three, and turn in
a single writeup as a group. Additionally, you may use *any* resource, as
long as you write up your answers in your own words and properly cite your
source. Some examples of resources you might use:

* other students in the class
* other students not in the class
* other instructors
* textbooks or online notes
* anything you find on the internet
* ChatGPT or other AI tools

## How to succeed in this class

What you can do:

What I can do:
* Grade assignments before the end of the week when they are turned in.
* Respond to all Piazza messages within one business day.
* Respond to all email messages within three business days.
* Create a course atmosphere conducive to learning by respecting
all of my students and being
enthusiastic about course material and my role in helping you learn.
