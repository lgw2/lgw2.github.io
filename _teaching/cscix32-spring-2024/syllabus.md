## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 332.
Advanced algorithm and data structure concepts, including theory, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, parallel algorithms, streaming algorithms, linear programming.

## Course info

This course meets in Social Sciences 362 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
9-10:20am.

This course will have two parts: in the first half, we will work to understand
what is computable and how fast using computer science theory developed in
the 20th century. This will give us a baseline to understand the
contemporary algorithms field and familiarity with the concepts, notation, and
proof styles necessary.
In the second half, we will learn a number of advanced algorithm
concepts and see how they are applied in current algorithms research. This will
be a highly interactive class, and although the material is challenging, I will
try to provide the appropriate level of support and I think students will get a
lot out of the course.

## Course resources

### Paper/chapter presentation and writeup rubrics

In the second half of the class, on Thursdays we will learn a new advanced algorithm topic and on Tuesdays a group will
lead a presentation of a book chapter or research paper related to that topic. Presenters should follow [these instructions](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/cscix32-spring-2024/paper_presentations/). On days that
a student is not a presenter, they must submit a paper/chapter summary to Gradescope according to [these instructions](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/cscix32-spring-2024/paper_writeups/).

### Moodle

We will use Moodle for course announcements and for homework submission.
Otherwise, all course information will be on this webpage, and any questions
about course logistics or content should be asked via [Piazza](https://lgw2.github.io/teaching/cscix32-spring-2024/syllabus/#piazza-discussion).

### Gradescope

Some assignments will be submitted using Gradescope. To join the class, visit the Gradescope [website](https://www.gradescope.com/) and login or signup, and use our course entry code `YDXKY7` to join the class.

### Group problem sessions

In the first half of the course, we will be working through concepts in
computer science theory. The best way to understand these concepts is through
practice and discussion. In order to provide you as much support as possible,
I will schedule and lead two weekly problem sessions where we will work through
problems that are similar to the homework that you turn in every Monday. These
are not required, but you can earn some participation points by attending, and
if you attend these problem sessions the homework should be much easier to
complete. Solutions will be shared after the problem sessions
are completed.

In the second half of the class, we will decide how we want to use the group
problem session time.

### Textbook

There is no textbook for this course; notes from various sources will be shared
as needed. However, there are a number of popular textbooks in this field, many
of which are available for free online. I will link textbook-style resources
here as we go.

### Lecture videos

Lectures will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=dcf4e4db-c07c-4d77-9063-b0f10157fd5d).

### Piazza discussion

Especially in the first half of the course, you will be working through
problems and I would like you to get help as soon as possible. We will use the
online tool Piazza to organize questions and answers. To join, follow the
[signup link](https://piazza.com/umt/spring2024/432532) and enter the access
code `9n3tn7iqak8`. Note that you do *not* need to use your university
email or real name if you prefer not to. Also, pay attention to the prompts to opt out of Piazza sharing your
information with recruiters.

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 20% participation (15 points for attending lecture sessions; 5 points for attending
    problem sessions during the theory section; 5 points for feedback after presentations during algorithms section; 5 points for check-out activity during finals week TBD--note that
    this sums to more than 20, so you do not need to get all of the points to
    get full credit for this category)
* 20% homework problems (during theory portion) (7 assignments; lowest score dropped)
* 20% problem presentations (during theory portion) (each student participates in 3)
* 20% paper presentations (during algorithms portion) (each student participates in two)
* 20% paper summaries (during algorithms portion) (7 papers total; each student writes 5 paper summaries)

Note that there are *no tests!*

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in Piazza with the `errors-in-course-material` tag.
If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy

For homework problems, you may work in groups of up to three and turn in
a single writeup as a group. Group work on paper summaries is TBD.

Additionally, you may use *any* resource available to you, as
long as you write up your answers in your own words and properly cite your
source. Some examples of resources you might use:

* other students in the class
* other students not in the class
* other instructors
* textbooks or online notes
* anything you find on the internet
* ChatGPT or other AI tools

Please ask if you have questions about how to properly cite a source or a
collaborator.
