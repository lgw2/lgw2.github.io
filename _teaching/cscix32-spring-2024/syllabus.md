## Course info



## Course resources

### Textbook

There is no textbook for this course; notes from various sources will be shared
as needed. However, there are a number of popular textbooks in this field, many
of which are available for free online:
* TODO, fill in

### Lecture videos

Lectures are recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=dcf4e4db-c07c-4d77-9063-b0f10157fd5d).

### Piazza discussion

Especially in the first half of the course, you will be working through
problems and I would like you to get help as soon as possible.


### Instructor office hours/extra lab time

## Course outcomes

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 20% participation
* 20% homework problems (in theory section)
* 20% problem presentations (in theory section)
* 20% paper summaries (in algorithms section)
* 20% paper presentations (in algorithms section)

Note that there are *no tests!*

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in Piazza (in TODO way). I will decide whether
it's truly an error. If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy

On all homework assignments, you may:
* Discuss, work through, problems and approaches with your peers.

## Important dates

## Diversity statement

## Accommodations

## How to succeed in this class

What you can do:

What I can do:
* Grade assignments promptly (exact guarantees TBD).
* Respond to all Piazza messages within one business day.
* Respond to all email messages within three business days.
* Create a course atmosphere conducive to learning by respecting
all of my students and being
enthusiastic about course material and my role in helping you learn.
