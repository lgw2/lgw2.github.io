title: "Paper writeup"
---

In every week that you are not a presenter, you will need to turn in a paper writeup. The goal of completing the paper writeup is to practice
reading a research paper with a specific goal in mind. For us, this specific goal is to understand how this paper relates to the previous week's
lecture topic.

The questions/tasks you must complete are:

1. As precisely as you can, state the algorithmic problem that the paper or chapter is trying to solve.
2. Does the paper describe any real-world applications of the problem? If yes, give at least one and explain how the algorithmic problem solves it. (Note: this is not asking you to explain the *algorithm*, it's asking you to explain how a *solution* to the algorithmic problem gives a *solution* to the real-world problem.)
3. Why is the algorithmic problem difficult?

If the paper or chapter addresses more than one algorithmic problem, you can just choose one for your responses.

Submit a PDF of your responses to the questions to Gradescope by 9pm the Monday night before the paper presentation.
