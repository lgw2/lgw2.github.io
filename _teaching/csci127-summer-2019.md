Catalog description: Provides a gentle introduction to the exciting world of big data and data science. Students expand their ability to solve problems with Python by learning to deploy lists, files, dictionaries and object-oriented programming. Data science libraries are introduced that enable data to be manipulated and displayed.

## Meeting times and locations
The course runs 6/10 through 7/5.

Lectures: Monday-Thursday, 8-10:35am in Barnard 126. These will be a mix of lectures and individual/group problem solving.

Labs: Monday-Thursday, 2-5pm in Barnard 254. On most days, you will have a lab assignment to complete individually or with a partner. You may also use this time to work on individual programming homework assignments.

## Course outcomes
By the end of this course, students should be be able to:

* Utilize lists, files, dictionaries and arrays to solve problems in Python.
* Utilize fundamental object oriented principles such as classes, objects, methods and inheritance to solve problems in Python.
* Utilize data science libraries to solve data science problems in Python.
* Understand the broad area of data science and its relevance.

## Grading
* Practicum 1: 15%
* Practicum 2: 15%
* Practicum 3: 25%
* Labs: 15% (all weighted equally)
* Programming homework assignments: 30% (all weighted equally)

To pass the course, you must average at least 50% on the practicums.
Assuming that this is the case, grades will be determined
(after any curving takes place) based on your total course score as follows:

* 93+: A
* 90+: A-
* 87+: B+
* 83+: B
* 80+: B-
* 77+: C+
* 73+: C
* 70+: C-
* 67+: D+
* 63: D
* 60: D-

## Collaboration policy

On both labs and programming homework assignments, you *may*:
* Share ideas with other individuals or groups.
* Help other individuals or groups troubleshooet problems
You may *not*:
* Share code you or your partner has written with other individuals or groups.
* Submit code that you or your partner did not write.
* Modify another group's or individual's solution and claim it as your own.
Failure to abide by these rules will result in an F for the course and
being reported to the Dean of Students.

## Diversity statement
Montana State University's campuses are committed to
providing an environment that emphasizes the dignity and worth of every member
of its community and that is free from harassment and discrimination based upon
race, color, religion, national origin, creed, service in the uniformed
services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran's status, sex, age,
political ideas, marital or family status, pregnancy, physical or mental
disability, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual
orientation. Such an environment is necessary to a healthy learning, working,
and living atmosphere because discrimination and harassment undermine human
dignity and the positive connection among all people at our University. Acts of
discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic
violence, stalking, and retaliation will be addressed consistent with this
policy.
