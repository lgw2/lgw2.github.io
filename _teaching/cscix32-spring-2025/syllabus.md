## Catalog description

3 Credits.
PREREQUISITE: CSCI 332.
Advanced algorithm and data structure concepts, including theory, approximation algorithms, randomized algorithms, parallel algorithms, streaming algorithms, linear programming.

## Course info

This course meets in Social Sciences 362 on Tuesdays and Thursdays from
9-10:20am.

This course will have two parts: in the first half, we will work to understand
what is computable and how fast using computer science theory developed in
the 20th century. This will give us a baseline to understand the
contemporary algorithms field and familiarity with the concepts, notation, and
proof styles necessary.
In the second half, we will learn a number of advanced algorithm
concepts and see how they are applied in current algorithms research. This will
be a highly interactive class, and although the material is challenging, I will
try to provide the appropriate level of support and I think students will get a
lot out of the course.

## Course resources

### Canvas

We will use Canvas for course announcements and for homework submission.
Otherwise, all course information will be on this webpage, and any questions
about course logistics or content should be asked via Discord. You can find the
invite to join the Discord on Canvas.

### Group problem sessions

In the first half of the course, we will be working through concepts in
computer science theory. The best way to understand these concepts is through
practice and discussion. In order to provide you as much support as possible,
I will schedule and lead two weekly problem sessions where we will work through
problems that are similar to the homework that you turn in every Monday. These
are not strictly required, but you can earn some participation points by attending, and
if you attend these problem sessions the homework should be much easier to
complete. Solutions will be shared after the problem sessions
are completed.

Please fill out this poll during the first week of class to help schedule
problem sessions: http://whenisgood.net/ayijc9tA.

### Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course; notes from various sources will be shared
as needed. However, there are a number of popular textbooks in this field, many
of which are available for free online. I will link textbook-style resources
here as we go. Everything here is available online for free.

* [Jeff Erickson's Algorithms Notes](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/). We follow the
*Models of Computation* notes at the bottom of the page in the first half of this class.
* [Avi Wigderson's *Mathematics and Computations](https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/bookA). Avi is one of the most
prolific computer science theorists of the modern age. He won the ACM Turing
award in 2023. His book offers a broad perspective on computer science theory
and has inspired some changes to our course for 2025.
* [Sipser's *Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.cengage.com/c/student/9781133187790/?filterBy=Student). *The* textbook on
    computer science theory, used in many computer science courses. Not
    officially available for free, but I bet you can figure out how to find a
    pdf online.

### Lecture videos

Lectures will be recorded and available to watch after class. However, if there are
technical difficulties recording a lecture, it will not be re-recorded, so come
to class when you can to make sure that you do not miss course content or
announcements. Videos can be found in the [Panopto folder](https://umontana.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=dcf4e4db-c07c-4d77-9063-b0f10157fd5d).

## Grading

You will be graded on the following:
* 20% participation (15 points for attending lecture sessions; 5 points for attending
    problem sessions during the theory section; 5 points for feedback after presentations during algorithms section; 5 points for check-out activity during finals week TBD--note that
    this sums to more than 20, so you do not need to get all of the points to
    get full credit for this category)
* 20% homework problems (during theory portion) (7 assignments; lowest score dropped)
* 20% problem presentations (during theory portion) (each student participates in 3)
* 20% paper presentations (during algorithms portion) (each student participates in two)
* 20% paper summaries (during algorithms portion) (7 papers total; each student writes 5 paper summaries)

Note that there are *no tests!*

After any curving, your grade will be determined by your total score as follows:
93+: A; 90+: A-; 87+: B+; 83+: B; 80+: B-; 77+: C+; 73+: C; 70+: C-; 67+: D+; 63: D; 60: D-.

### Bonus

There are two ways to earn bonus points in this class.

#### Catch errors in course materials

If you find an error in any of the course materials (typo, incorrect statement, etc.), make a post in Piazza with the `errors-in-course-material` tag.
If it is really an error, you get a
quarter of a point. Only the first person to post about an error gets the points. You can earn a max of 1 total point toward your 100 for the course (for four errors).

#### Course survey and evaluation

If 100% of the class completes the mid-semester course survey, the whole
class gets 1 bonus point. Same goes for the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

### Collaboration policy

For homework problems, you may work in groups of up to three and turn in
a single writeup as a group. Group work on paper summaries is not allowed.

Additionally, you may use *any* resource available to you, as
long as you write up your answers in your own words and properly cite your
source. Some examples of resources you might use:

* other students in the class
* other students not in the class
* other instructors
* textbooks or online notes
* anything you find on the internet
* ChatGPT or other AI tools

Please ask if you have questions about how to properly cite a source or a
collaborator.
